## ⚠️ CRITICAL: CLAIM CALIBRATION (Epistemic Humility)

**Academic writing requires confidence that matches evidence strength.**

Marketing-style language destroys academic credibility. Scan and soften overconfident claims.

### Banned Phrases (Auto-Replace)

| ❌ Overconfident | ✅ Calibrated Replacement |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| "indisputable" | "strong evidence suggests" |
| "proves conclusively" | "provides strong support for" |
| "without doubt" | "with high confidence" |
| "the only" | "among the few" / "a primary" |
| "the best" | "among the strongest" / "highly effective" |
| "revolutionary" | "represents significant advancement" |
| "paradigm shift" | "important development" (unless citing Kuhn) |
| "always" | "in most studied contexts" / "consistently" |
| "never" | "rarely" / "in no observed cases" |
| "perfect" | "highly accurate" / "near-optimal" |
| "solves" | "addresses" / "substantially mitigates" |
| "proves" | "supports" / "demonstrates" |

### Calibration Rules

**Rule 1: Match confidence to evidence**
- Strong evidence (multiple RCTs, meta-analyses) → Can use confident language
- Moderate evidence (observational studies) → Use hedged language
- Weak evidence (single study, pilot) → Must hedge heavily

**Rule 2: Absolute claims need absolute evidence**
- "Always works" requires evidence across ALL contexts
- "The best" requires comparison to ALL alternatives
- If you can't prove "all," don't claim "all"

**Rule 3: Comparative claims need comparisons**
- "Superior performance" → Superior to what? By how much?
- "Significant improvement" → Statistically significant? Effect size?

### Overconfidence Detection Pattern

```
🔴 OVERCONFIDENT CLAIMS DETECTED

**Line 45:** "Indisputable predictive power"
→ Replace with: "Strong predictive associations, though generalizability varies"

**Line 123:** "This approach solves the problem of..."
→ Replace with: "This approach substantially addresses..."

**Line 267:** "The best method for age prediction"
→ Replace with: "Among the most accurate methods for age prediction"

**Total overconfident claims:** 8
**Auto-corrections applied:** 8
```

### The Calibration Test

Before finalizing, ask for EACH strong claim:
1. Do I have evidence for ALL cases this implies?
2. Would a skeptical reviewer accept this wording?
3. Am I claiming more than my sources support?

If any answer is "no" → Soften the claim.

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY & VERIFICATION

**CRITICAL:** While refining, preserve all citations and verification markers.

**Your responsibilities:**
1. **Never remove citations** during editing
2. **Preserve [VERIFY] markers** - don't hide uncertainty
3. **Don't add unsupported claims** even if they improve flow
4. **Maintain DOI/arXiv IDs** in all citations
5. **Flag if refinements created uncited claims**

**Polish the writing, not the evidence. Verification depends on accurate citations.**
