# Paper Architecture

**Paper Type:** Master's Thesis (Empirical Case Study & Policy Analysis)
**Research Question:** How effective are the organizational mechanisms and management structures of the State Medical Emergency Service (PRM) in the Pomeranian Voivodeship in implementing state public health policy?
**Target Venue:** University Repository / Academic Defense (Master's Level)
**Estimated Length:** 25,000 - 30,000 words (approx. 80-100 pages)

## Core Argument Flow

**Draft Statement:**
While the centralized planning model supervised by the Pomeranian Voivode ensures logistical coverage across the region's 93 teams, the current organizational structure prioritizes economic efficiency (cost-cutting via team composition changes) over clinical resilience, creating a "safety gap" that current administrative supervision fails to detect.

**Logical Progression:**
1. **Context:** Public health policy relies on the PRM system to guarantee health security (Introduction/Ch1).
2. **Problem:** The system is undergoing a transition from physician-led to paramedic-led teams under strict budget constraints (Ch2/Lit Review).
3. **Case:** The Pomeranian Voivodeship manages 93 teams through a specific "Action Plan" (Plan Działania) involving the Voivode and NFZ (Ch4).
4. **Analysis:** Evaluation of this structure reveals effective logistical coordination but significant gaps in quality assurance and workforce fatigue management (Ch5/6).
5. **Conclusion:** The organizational model requires new supervision metrics that measure patient safety and staff endurance, not just response times and costs (Ch7/Conclusion).

## Argument Flow Map

```
Introduction: State has a duty to provide health security via PRM.
 ↓
Ch 1-2 (Theory/Legal): The system is designed as a rigid administrative hierarchy (Voivode -> System -> Patient).
 ↓
Ch 4 (Case Data): In Pomerania, this translates to 93 teams distributed geographically.
 ↓
Ch 5 (Analysis): The Voivode effectively plans logistics (where ambulances sit) but lacks tools to manage clinical quality (what happens inside).
 ↓
Ch 6 (The Gap): The shift from Doctors to Paramedics (Gap 1) is being managed as a financial spreadsheet exercise, ignoring clinical risks and staff fatigue (Gap 2).
 ↓
Conclusion: The organization is "administratively correct" but "clinically vulnerable." Recommendations needed for quality-based supervision.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Title Promise Fulfillment Audit

**Title:** "Badanie organizacji realizacji państwowej polityki..." (Study of organization of state policy implementation...)

| Promised Element | How the Outline Delivers |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| **"Badanie organizacji"** (Study of organization) | **Ch 5** is dedicated entirely to management structures, supervision, and the Voivode/NFZ relationship. |
| **"Realizacja polityki"** (Policy implementation) | **Ch 4 & 6** compare the *Strategic Plan* (Policy) against *Operational Reality* (Implementation). |
| **"Region Pomorski"** (Pomeranian Region) | **Ch 4** is a deep dive into Pomeranian demographics/geography; **Ch 6** uses specific Pomeranian team data. |
| **"Państwowe Ratownictwo Medyczne"** (PRM) | **Ch 2** defines the PRM legal framework; the whole thesis focuses on PRM units (ZRM/SOR). |

## Writing Priorities for the Student

1. **Access the "Wojewódzki Plan Działania":** This document is the core of your case study. You must analyze the latest version available for Pomerania.
2. **Define "Effectiveness":** In Chapter 1, clearly define if you mean "Cost Effectiveness" (saving money) or "Clinical Effectiveness" (saving lives). The tension between these two is your main argument in Chapter 6.
3. **The "Voivode" Focus:** Since the prompt specifically mentions the Voivode, ensure Chapter 5 critically evaluates their tools. Do they have real power, or do they just sign papers from NFZ?
4. **Use the Gaps:** Use the "Telemedicine/Doctor Removal" gap (Gap 1) as a major discussion point in Chapter 6. Is Pomerania replacing doctors with paramedics? If so, how are they monitoring safety?
