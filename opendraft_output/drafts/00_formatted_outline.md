## Chapter 1: Introduction
*(Wstęp)*
**Length:** ~2,000 words

### 1.1 Background of the Study
- Definition of health security as a component of national security.
- The role of the State (Voivode) in ensuring public safety.
- Brief introduction to the PRM system in Poland.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
- The shift from physician-led (*zespoły specjalistyczne "S"*) to paramedic-led (*zespoły podstawowe "P"*) teams.
- The tension between the "Action Plan" (*Plan Działania*) logistics and actual operational reality.
- The "Safety Gap": metrics focus on speed/cost, ignoring resilience.

### 1.3 Research Question and Hypotheses
- **Primary RQ:** How effective are the organizational mechanisms and management structures of the PRM in the Pomeranian Voivodeship in implementing state public health policy?
- **Sub-questions:**
 1. Does the current financing model support clinical quality?
 2. Is the administrative supervision by the Voivode sufficient to detect systemic risks?

### 1.4 Significance of the Study
- Contribution to public management theory in healthcare.
- Practical implications for the Pomeranian Voivodeship Office (*Pomorski Urząd Wojewódzki*).

### 1.5 Thesis Structure
- Roadmap of the following chapters.

- Poland’s transition and the specific role of the PRM Act (*Ustawa o Państwowym Ratownictwie Medycznym*).

### 2.3 New Public Management (NPM) in Healthcare
- Efficiency, cost-cutting, and performance metrics.
- Critique of NPM in high-reliability organizations (like emergency services).

### 2.4 Organizational Effectiveness Metrics
- How effectiveness is measured in public services (Output vs. Outcome).
- The concept of "Clinical Resilience."

- Mixed-methods approach (Qualitative document analysis + Quantitative structural data).

### 3.2 Data Sources
- **Primary:** The "Action Plan of the System" (*Plan Działania systemu PRM dla województwa pomorskiego*).
- **Secondary:** Reports from the Supreme Audit Office (NIK), National Health Fund (NFZ), and Voivodeship crisis management reports.

### 3.3 Data Collection Procedures
- Criteria for analyzing the 93 teams.
- Selection of timeframes for analysis.

### 3.4 Analysis Methods

### 5.2 Structural Transformation
- **Trend Analysis:** The reduction of "S" teams (physician-led) over the last 5-10 years.
- **Economic Impact:** Cost savings achieved through this transition.

### 5.3 The "Safety Gap" Analysis
- **Workforce Issues:** Paramedic fatigue and shortage analysis.
- **System Overload:** Frequency of "lack of available team" incidents.
