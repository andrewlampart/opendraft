## Abstract

Purpose: The purpose of the article is to present the organization and financing of the 
emergency medical services system in Poland, against the background of model solutions in 
this matter. 
Design/methodology/approach: The methodology of the study is based on the analysis of 
existing legal regulations on the organization of the emergency medical services system in 
Poland. A review of the available literature, in which the authors addressed issues related to 
models of functioning of the emergency medical services system, was also carried out. 
Statistical data provided by the Statistics Poland (GUS) and reports on the implementation of 
the financial plan provided by the National Health Fund (NFZ) were reviewed. 
Findings: The State Emergency Medical Service system is evolving towards the Anglo
American model. The previous model of financing through a subsidy from the state budget has 
proved insufficient. In the years under review (2007-2022), the subsidy was insufficient to 
cover the costs of operating the State Emergency Medical Service. After a change in the method 
of financing, the burden of covering operating costs was transferred to the National Health 
Fund. In 2023, costs were planned to be higher than they were actually incurred. Year after 
year, however, the system requires higher expenses. 
Originality/value: The publication addresses issues related to the organization of state 
emergency medical services in Poland. The subject matter is relevant in the context of the 
current socio-economic and political situation and is a contribution to further in-depth research 
in a situation of shortage of resources allocated to health care.
