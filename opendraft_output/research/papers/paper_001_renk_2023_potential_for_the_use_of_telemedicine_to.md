### Research Question
How can live streaming and telemedicine tools mitigate the critical shortage of physicians and financial constraints in the Polish National Emergency Medical Service (NEMS) within the Pomorskie Province?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Forecast/Simulation and Economic Analysis.
- **Approach:** Analysis of legislative frameworks and the Provincial Action Plan for Pomorskie Province. The authors modeled a new organizational structure integrating live streaming.
- **Data:** Financial data and staffing metrics from the Pomorskie Province NEMS.

### Key Findings
1. **Cost Reduction:** Implementing live streaming would reduce NEMS operational costs in the province by **PLN 10,190,800.00 per year**.
2. **Staffing Efficiency:** The system could operate effectively with only **16 physicians**, representing just **10%** of current resource allocation.
3. **Resource Reallocation:** Approximately **90%** of physicians currently in NEMS could be redeployed to other strained sectors of the healthcare system.

### Implications
This paper proposes a radical structural shift from physician-staffed ambulances (Specialist Teams "S") to paramedic-led teams supported by remote tele-physicians. It suggests a viable solution to the "medical desert" phenomenon in pre-hospital care, potentially serving as a blueprint for other regions facing staff shortages.

### Limitations
- **Simulation-based:** The findings are forecasted, not empirical results from a field trial.
- **Technological dependence:** Relies heavily on robust connectivity, which may vary in rural areas.
- **Clinical risk:** Does not explicitly measure patient safety outcomes in the forecasted model, only financial and staffing metrics.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Why:** This is a critical modernization paper proposing a specific, quantified solution (telemedicine) to the systemic problem (staffing/funding) identified in the broader literature.
