### Research Question
How do members of Emergency Medical Teams (EMT) cope with "difficult situations," and what factors influence their decision-making and conduct during traumatic events?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Cross-sectional Observational Study (Diagnostic Survey).
- **Approach:** Author-designed questionnaire.
- **Data:** **120 EMT members** (101 men, 19 women).
- **Analysis:** Pearson Chi-Square test for variable dependencies.

### Key Findings
1. **Pediatric Trauma:** The most traumatic situations identified by respondents are sudden events involving **children**.
2. **"Load and Go" Stress:** Paramedics identified "Load and Go" (rapid transport) scenarios as highly difficult, suggesting pressure to perform rapid interventions creates significant stress.
3. **Psychiatric Patients:** Events involving agitated/psychiatric patients were rated as causing the *least* problems, contrary to some common assumptions about safety.
4. **Experience vs. Fatigue:** **Work time and rest** significantly impacted correct conduct. Surprisingly, **knowledge, professional experience, age, and gender** had *no statistically significant influence* on correct conduct in traumatic situations.

### Implications
This challenges the assumption that "veteran" paramedics handle trauma better. It highlights that physiological factors (fatigue) are more critical than tenure. It suggests a need for better psychological support regarding pediatric cases and fatigue management rather than just more clinical training.

### Limitations
- **Self-reported data:** Relies on survey responses rather than observation of actual clinical performance.
- **Sample bias:** Heavily male-dominated sample (84%), though this may reflect the workforce demographics in Poland.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Why:** Provides the "Human Factor" element. While Paper 1 discusses systems/money, this paper discusses the psychological toll and operational limits of the people doing the work.
