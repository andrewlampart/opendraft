## Abstract

Abstract
                
                  Background
                  This study examines the multifaceted determinants of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) response times through a machine learning approach. Using data from over one million EMS missions spanning 2017 to 2022, this research aims to understand and predict factors influencing response times, highlighting the role of machine learning in optimizing emergency services.
                  Methods
                  Advanced machine learning techniques, including Gradient Boosting models, were employed to analyze response times across various emergency scenarios. The data set was carefully curated to consider numerous factors such as urgency levels, call handling times, travel times, and geographical and temporal variables.
                  Results
                  The analysis confirms significant variability in response times influenced by factors such as the urgency of calls, weather conditions. Adverse weather and extreme temperatures were found to exacerbate response times significantly. Central urban areas showed faster response times compared to remote regions. The machine learning models effectively identified and quantified these impacts, offering a nuanced understanding that can inform more targeted EMS deployment strategies.
                  Conclusions
                  The findings advocate for the integration of real-time data on traffic, weather, and incident specifics into EMS resource allocation strategies to optimize response times dynamically. This approach underscores the importance of leveraging predictive analytics in emergency response planning, enhancing service delivery and patient outcomes. The study not only contributes to academic knowledge but also provides practical insights for emergency service administrators aiming to improve operational efficiency and response effectiveness.
