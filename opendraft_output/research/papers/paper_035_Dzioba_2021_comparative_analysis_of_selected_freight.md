## Abstract

The Three Seas Initiative, which gathers 12 European countries located from the Baltic Sea, the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea, is both an opportunity and a challenge for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The concept has primarily a regional dimension, while its global impact is appreciated and supported by, among others, Scandinavian countries and the U.S. government. While the potential for economic development within the scope this initiative is high, in order to develop it, there is a need to modernize the transporting, energetic and digital infrastructure necessary for the implementation of logistic processes. It is also necessary to change legal regulations. The article describes the international economic and political initiative gathering selected countries in the Three Seas area and characterizes the purposefulness of the application of European Modular Systems. On the basis of previously selected features influencing the increase of economic efficiency and appropriately selected weights, a comparative analysis of selected cargo means was conducted. The Bellinger’s method was applied in order to conduct the comparative analysis. Based on the analysis of the obtained research results, the benefits of using sets with increased loading capacity on a selected route between the ports of the Baltic Sea and the Adriatic Sea were demonstrated.
