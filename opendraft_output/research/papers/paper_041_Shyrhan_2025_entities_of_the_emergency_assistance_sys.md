## Abstract

The article presents a comprehensive research of the composition of the entities involved in the emergency assistance system for the population through the single emergency number 112, which serves as a key element of the state’s public safety infrastructure. The relevance of the topic stems from the constant growth of threats of various kinds, which require rapid, coordinated, and institutionally organized responses by state structures. The implementation of the System 112 in Ukraine, as part of the pan-European model of emergency assistance, requires a clear definition of its participants, their powers, functions, and responsibilities within the legal framework. 
The research identifies and characterizes the main entities included in the System 112: the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, the National Police of Ukraine, the Emergency Medical Service (units of the Ministry of Health/National Health Service of Ukraine), Emergency service of gas, telecommunications operators, as well as coordinating bodies, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. Special attention is paid to the institutional role of local self-government bodies and executive authorities, which ensure accessibility and organizational functioning of the 112 service at the local level. It is clarified that technical coordination of emergency calls, load distribution among dispatch centers, and monitoring of call processing are performed by specialized structural units within the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
The article defines the powers of each system participant: the State Emergency Service responds to natural and man-made emergencies, conducts rescue operations and firefighting; the National Police is responsible for responding to crimes and threats to public order and safety; the emergency medical service ensures the deployment of mobile teams in cases of threats to life or health; Emergency service of gas processes reports of gas leaks, damage to gas pipelines, and the threat of explosion; telecommunications operators provide free and uninterrupted access to the 112 service; local self-government bodies are responsible for organizing logistics, ensuring local resources, and providing premises for emergency response centers. Functional interagency cooperation, information exchange mechanisms, and dispatch procedures are identified as essential components of the effective operation of the System 112. 
The conclusions and proposals formulated in the article may serve as a foundation for further improvement of the legal and regulatory framework governing the activities of the entities within the System 112, particularly in terms of delineating powers, enhancing interagency integration, and unifying response standards across the territory of Ukraine, taking into account European approaches.
