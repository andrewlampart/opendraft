**Authors:** Stańczak, A.
**Year:** 2015

**DOI:** 10.15199/59.2015.4.13

### Research Question
How can the Insigma IT system integrate with Poland's National Emergency Notification System (KSPR) to improve data flow and dispatching?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Technical/System Architecture Analysis.
- **Approach:** Evaluation of interface protocols and data exchange standards.

### Key Findings
1. **Integration Protocols:** Defines the technical requirements for interoperability between dispatch software and national emergency databases.
2. **Data Flow:** [VERIFY] Likely addresses the speed of information transfer from the 112 operator to the Medical Dispatcher.

### Implications
Highlights the "Backbone" of the EMS system. Without functional IT integration (like Insigma), the telemedicine solutions proposed in Paper 1 (2023) are impossible. This represents the foundational work done in the mid-2010s.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Why:** Contextualizes the technological timeline. Shows that IT integration was a focus 8 years prior to the push for live streaming.
