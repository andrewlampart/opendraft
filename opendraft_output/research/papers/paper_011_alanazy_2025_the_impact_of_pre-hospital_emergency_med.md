### Research Question
Does pre-hospital EMS intervention significantly improve clinical outcomes for burn patients compared to direct transport or no pre-hospital care?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
- **Approach:** Aggregation of global data on burn outcomes relative to EMS care.
- **Data:** [VERIFY exact number of studies included in full text].

### Key Findings
1. **Outcome Correlation:** [VERIFY] typically, such studies assess mortality rates, length of hospital stay, and infection rates. The abstract implies an assessment of "impact," likely looking for positive correlations between ALS (Advanced Life Support) and survival.
2. **Pre-hospital Interventions:** Focuses on fluid resuscitation, airway management, and cooling.

*Note: Full findings are truncated in source, but the 2025 date suggests this is the most current evidence baseline.*

### Implications
Establishes the clinical necessity of EMS. If EMS interventions improve burn outcomes, it justifies investments in the systems discussed in Paper 1 and Paper 6.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Why:** Provides clinical validity. It moves the discussion from "how do we organize ambulances" to "do ambulances actually save lives in specific pathologies."
