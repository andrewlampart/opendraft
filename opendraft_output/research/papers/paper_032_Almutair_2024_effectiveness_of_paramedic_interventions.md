## Abstract

Background: Pre-hospital emergency care plays a critical role in reducing morbidity and mortality among patients experiencing acute medical and traumatic events. Paramedics serve as frontline responders, delivering rapid, often life-saving interventions before hospital arrival. As the scope of paramedic practice continues to expand, evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions is essential to improving outcomes and optimizing emergency medical services (EMS) systems. 
Objective: This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of paramedic-led interventions in pre-hospital emergency care, focusing on clinical outcomes, patient safety, and response efficiency. 
Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across five major databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and EMBASE) for peer-reviewed studies published between 2016 and 2024. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and observational research evaluating clinical outcomes of paramedic-administered interventions. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers following PRISMA guidelines. 
Results: Out of 2,347 identified records, 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Interventions analyzed included airway management, defibrillation, hemorrhage control, analgesia, stroke identification, and early sepsis treatment. Evidence suggests that timely paramedic interventions are associated with improved survival rates in cardiac arrest, better pain management, and faster recognition of time-sensitive conditions such as stroke and sepsis. However, variations in protocols, training levels, and patient populations limited the ability to generalize some findings. 
Conclusion: Paramedic-led interventions in the pre-hospital setting are generally effective in improving patient outcomes, particularly when guided by standardized protocols and supported by continuous training. Further high-quality research is needed to strengthen the evidence base and support the development of best-practice models in EMS systems.
