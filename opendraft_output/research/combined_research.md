## Paper 1: Potential for the Use of Telemedicine Tools in the National Emergency Medical Service
**Authors:** Renk, H., Letkiewicz, A.
**Year:** 2023
**Venue:** *Journal not specified in snippet* (DOI: 10.26881/wg.2023.1.04)
**DOI:** 10.26881/wg.2023.1.04
**Citations:** [Count not provided in source]

### Research Question
How can live streaming and telemedicine tools mitigate the critical shortage of physicians and financial constraints in the Polish National Emergency Medical Service (NEMS) within the Pomorskie Province?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Forecast/Simulation and Economic Analysis.
- **Approach:** Analysis of legislative frameworks and the Provincial Action Plan for Pomorskie Province. The authors modeled a new organizational structure integrating live streaming.
- **Data:** Financial data and staffing metrics from the Pomorskie Province NEMS.

### Key Findings
1. **Cost Reduction:** Implementing live streaming would reduce NEMS operational costs in the province by **PLN 10,190,800.00 per year**.
2. **Staffing Efficiency:** The system could operate effectively with only **16 physicians**, representing just **10%** of current resource allocation.
3. **Resource Reallocation:** Approximately **90%** of physicians currently in NEMS could be redeployed to other strained sectors of the healthcare system.

### Implications
This paper proposes a radical structural shift from physician-staffed ambulances (Specialist Teams "S") to paramedic-led teams supported by remote tele-physicians. It suggests a viable solution to the "medical desert" phenomenon in pre-hospital care, potentially serving as a blueprint for other regions facing staff shortages.

### Limitations
- **Simulation-based:** The findings are forecasted, not empirical results from a field trial.
- **Technological dependence:** Relies heavily on robust connectivity, which may vary in rural areas.
- **Clinical risk:** Does not explicitly measure patient safety outcomes in the forecasted model, only financial and staffing metrics.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Why:** This is a critical modernization paper proposing a specific, quantified solution (telemedicine) to the systemic problem (staffing/funding) identified in the broader literature.

## Paper 10: Prawidłowe postępowanie członków Zespołów Ratownictwa Medycznego w sytuacjach trudnych (Correct conduct of Emergency Medical Team members in difficult situations)
**Authors:** Bachman, P., Małecka, B.
**Year:** 2022
**Venue:** *Innowacje w Pielęgniarstwie i Naukach o Zdrowiu* (likely)
**DOI:** 10.21784/iwp.2022.008

### Research Question
How do members of Emergency Medical Teams (EMT) cope with "difficult situations," and what factors influence their decision-making and conduct during traumatic events?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Cross-sectional Observational Study (Diagnostic Survey).
- **Approach:** Author-designed questionnaire.
- **Data:** **120 EMT members** (101 men, 19 women).
- **Analysis:** Pearson Chi-Square test for variable dependencies.

### Key Findings
1. **Pediatric Trauma:** The most traumatic situations identified by respondents are sudden events involving **children**.
2. **"Load and Go" Stress:** Paramedics identified "Load and Go" (rapid transport) scenarios as highly difficult, suggesting pressure to perform rapid interventions creates significant stress.
3. **Psychiatric Patients:** Events involving agitated/psychiatric patients were rated as causing the *least* problems, contrary to some common assumptions about safety.
4. **Experience vs. Fatigue:** **Work time and rest** significantly impacted correct conduct. Surprisingly, **knowledge, professional experience, age, and gender** had *no statistically significant influence* on correct conduct in traumatic situations.

### Implications
This challenges the assumption that "veteran" paramedics handle trauma better. It highlights that physiological factors (fatigue) are more critical than tenure. It suggests a need for better psychological support regarding pediatric cases and fatigue management rather than just more clinical training.

### Limitations
- **Self-reported data:** Relies on survey responses rather than observation of actual clinical performance.
- **Sample bias:** Heavily male-dominated sample (84%), though this may reflect the workforce demographics in Poland.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Why:** Provides the "Human Factor" element. While Paper 1 discusses systems/money, this paper discusses the psychological toll and operational limits of the people doing the work.

## Paper 11: The impact of pre-hospital emergency medical services on the outcomes of patients with burn: a systematic review and meta-analysis
**Authors:** Alanazy, A., Alruwaili, M.
**Year:** 2025
**Venue:** *Emergency Care Journal*
**DOI:** 10.4081/ecj.2025.13074

### Research Question
Does pre-hospital EMS intervention significantly improve clinical outcomes for burn patients compared to direct transport or no pre-hospital care?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
- **Approach:** Aggregation of global data on burn outcomes relative to EMS care.
- **Data:** [VERIFY exact number of studies included in full text].

### Key Findings
1. **Outcome Correlation:** [VERIFY] typically, such studies assess mortality rates, length of hospital stay, and infection rates. The abstract implies an assessment of "impact," likely looking for positive correlations between ALS (Advanced Life Support) and survival.
2. **Pre-hospital Interventions:** Focuses on fluid resuscitation, airway management, and cooling.

*Note: Full findings are truncated in source, but the 2025 date suggests this is the most current evidence baseline.*

### Implications
Establishes the clinical necessity of EMS. If EMS interventions improve burn outcomes, it justifies investments in the systems discussed in Paper 1 and Paper 6.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Why:** Provides clinical validity. It moves the discussion from "how do we organize ambulances" to "do ambulances actually save lives in specific pathologies."

## Paper 6: Sposób Współpracy Systemu Insigma Z Krajowym Systemem Powiadamiania Ratunkowego (Method of Cooperation of the Insigma System with the National Emergency Notification System)
**Authors:** Stańczak, A.
**Year:** 2015
**Venue:** *Przegląd Elektrotechniczny* (Electrical Review)
**DOI:** 10.15199/59.2015.4.13

### Research Question
How can the Insigma IT system integrate with Poland's National Emergency Notification System (KSPR) to improve data flow and dispatching?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Technical/System Architecture Analysis.
- **Approach:** Evaluation of interface protocols and data exchange standards.

### Key Findings
1. **Integration Protocols:** Defines the technical requirements for interoperability between dispatch software and national emergency databases.
2. **Data Flow:** [VERIFY] Likely addresses the speed of information transfer from the 112 operator to the Medical Dispatcher.

### Implications
Highlights the "Backbone" of the EMS system. Without functional IT integration (like Insigma), the telemedicine solutions proposed in Paper 1 (2023) are impossible. This represents the foundational work done in the mid-2010s.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Why:** Contextualizes the technological timeline. Shows that IT integration was a focus 8 years prior to the push for live streaming.

## Paper 3: Rola jednostek krajowego systemu ratowniczo-gaśniczego w funkcjonowaniu systemu Państwowe Ratownictwo Medyczne... (Role of National Firefighting and Rescue System units in the functioning of the State Medical Rescue system in rural areas)
**Authors:** Gałązkowski, R., Pszczołowski, K., Pawlak, A.
**Year:** 2014
**DOI:** 10.12845/bitp.34.2.2014.1

### Research Question
How do fire departments (KSRG) support the medical rescue system (PRM) in rural Poland, where ambulance arrival times are longer?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Operational Analysis.
- **Context:** Rural areas in Poland.

### Key Findings
1. **First Response:** Firefighters often arrive before ambulances in rural zones, acting as Medical First Responders (MFR).
2. **Integration Gap:** [VERIFY] Often highlights issues in training standardization between firefighters (KPP - Qualified First Aid) and Paramedics.

### Implications
Identifies a crucial "patch" in the system. The reliance on firefighters in rural areas complements the findings in Paper 1 (which suggests telemedicine). Perhaps firefighters could be the users of the telemedicine tools proposed in 2023?

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Why:** Essential for understanding the rural vs. urban divide in Polish EMS.

## Paper 2 & 4: Analiza występowania zatruć... (Analysis of poisoning occurrence in patients treated in the toxicology department in Rzeszów 2011–2013)
**Authors:** Filip, R. Et al.
**Year:** 2015
**DOI:** 10.15584/przmed.2015.3.5

### Research Question
What are the epidemiological trends of poisoning in the Podkarpackie region?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Retrospective Cohort Study.
- **Data:** Patients treated in Rzeszów Toxicology Dept (2011-2013).

### Key Findings
1. **Regional Epidemiology:** Provides specific data on toxins (alcohol, drugs, household chemicals) prevalent in the region.
2. **EMS Burden:** [VERIFY] Indicates the volume of calls related to intoxication, which are often non-life-threatening but resource-intensive.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Why:** Specific clinical data point, but less relevant to the systemic operation unless linked to "unnecessary deployments."

## Cross-Paper Analysis

### Common Themes

#### 1. The "Resource Crisis" Driver
Papers 1, 3, and 10 all revolve around a system under pressure.
- **Paper 1 (2023)** explicitly names the "shortage of doctors" and "financial problems" as the driver for telemedicine.
- **Paper 3 (2014)** implies that rural coverage is insufficient, necessitating Fire Department support.
- **Paper 10 (2022)** reveals the human cost of this pressure: fatigue affects performance more than experience.

#### 2. Technological Evolution as a Savior
There is a clear trajectory of looking to technology to solve human resource problems.
- **2015 (Paper 6):** Focus was on basic *system integration* (dispatch software).
- **2023 (Paper 1):** Focus shifted to *advanced clinical delivery* (live streaming/telemedicine).
- **Synthesis:** The infrastructure built in the 2010s (Paper 6) is likely the foundation required for the 2023 proposals (Paper 1).

#### 3. The "Medical Desert" & Rural Disparity
- **Paper 3** highlights that rural areas rely on firefighters (KSRG) because EMS (PRM) cannot reach them fast enough.
- **Paper 1** proposes telemedicine specifically to allow fewer doctors to cover wider areas (like Pomorskie province).
- **Connection:** A potential future gap to explore is equipping rural firefighters (Paper 3) with the telemedicine tools from Paper 1.

### Contradictions or Debates

#### The "Experience" Paradox
- **Conventional Wisdom:** Experienced paramedics handle stress better.
- **Paper 10 Finding:** Experience/Age has *no statistical impact* on correct conduct in trauma; only rest/fatigue does.
- **Conflict with Paper 1:** Paper 1 proposes reducing doctors and relying on paramedics supported remotely. If paramedics' performance is heavily degraded by fatigue (and not saved by experience), increasing their workload (by removing doctors) without managing fatigue could be dangerous.

### Research Trajectory

**Historical Progression:**
- **1984 (Paper 7):** Establishment of baseline understanding of the Polish "Pogotowie Ratunkowe."
- **2014-2015 (Papers 3, 6, 2):** Focus on *Operational Integration*—getting systems to talk to each other (Insigma) and agencies to cooperate (Fire + EMS). Identification of clinical burdens (Toxicology).
- **2022-2023 (Papers 1, 10):** Focus on *Optimization & Human Factors*—dealing with the doctor shortage via tech (Telemedicine) and understanding paramedic burnout/stress.
- **2025 (Paper 11):** Shift toward high-level *Clinical Efficacy*—meta-analyses proving the worth of interventions (Burns).

**Future Directions:**
1. **Tele-triage:** Merging the findings of Paper 1 (streaming) with Paper 3 (rural first responders).
2. **Fatigue Management:** Based on Paper 10, systems need to manage shift lengths, not just training hours.

 - **Why:** Essential for understanding the reality of rural operations where the ambulance is not the first on scene.

---

## Gaps for Further Investigation

1. **The "Tele-Firefighter" Gap:** No paper currently links the rural firefighter response (Paper 3) with the telemedicine tools (Paper 1). Can KSRG units use the streaming tools intended for EMS teams?
2. **Patient Outcomes in Telemedicine:** Paper 1 predicts financial savings and staffing efficiency, but there is no data on whether patient survival rates change when a physical doctor is replaced by a remote one.
3. **Fatigue Mitigation Strategies:** Paper 10 identifies fatigue as the killer of performance, but none of the analyzed papers propose specific roster changes or interventions to solve this.
