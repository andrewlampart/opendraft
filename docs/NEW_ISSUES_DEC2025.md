## TICKET-017: Planning/Thinking Leakage into Output

**Severity:** Critical
**Affected Agents:** Crafter, all composition agents
**Current Behavior:** LLM outputs its planning/thinking before the actual content:

```
Okay, I understand. I will write a comprehensive literature review...
Here's the plan:
1. **Set the language**: Determine...
2. **Outline**: Expand...
```

**Problem:** This meta-content pollutes the academic output. Users get "LLM planning" instead of clean paper content.

**Required Fix:**
Add to crafter.md:

```markdown
## ⚠️ CRITICAL: NO PLANNING/THINKING IN OUTPUT

**ZERO TOLERANCE for meta-commentary in output.**

Your output should be ONLY the paper content. Never include:
- "Okay, I understand..."
- "Here's my plan..."
- "I will write..."
- "Let me first..."
- Numbered planning steps
- Meta-discussion about the task

❌ WRONG:
"Okay, I understand. I will write a literature review on epigenetics.
Here's the plan:
1. Introduction
2. Methods
...
Here's the output:
# Literature Review"

✅ CORRECT:
"# Literature Review
[Direct academic content starts here]"
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] No "Okay, I understand" or similar preambles
- [ ] No numbered planning steps
- [ ] Output starts directly with content

## TICKET-018: Metadata Sections Leaking into Output

**Severity:** Critical
**Affected Agents:** Crafter
**Current Behavior:** Internal tracking sections appear in output:

```markdown
**Section:** Literature Review
**Word Count:** 2294
**Status:** Draft v1

**Citations Used**
{cite_001}...

**Notes for Revision:**
* Fill in missing citations...
```

**Problem:** These are internal tracking sections that should NOT appear in the final output.

**Required Fix:**
Strengthen the existing guidance in crafter.md about clean output format.

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] No `**Section:**` metadata
- [ ] No `**Word Count:**` metadata
- [ ] No `**Status:**` metadata
- [ ] No `**Citations Used**` section
- [ ] No `**Notes for Revision**` section

## TICKET-019: cite_MISSING Markers in Output

**Severity:** Critical
**Affected Agents:** Crafter
**Current Behavior:** LLM uses `{cite_MISSING: description}` when it can't find a citation:

```
{cite_MISSING: Kirkwood's disposable soma theory, general aging theory}
{cite_MISSING: general explanation of biological aging vs chronological aging}
```

**Problem:** These are placeholder markers that should not appear in output. The LLM should either:
1. Use an available citation from the database
2. Mark with [VERIFY] if uncertain
3. Rephrase to not require the citation

**Required Fix:**
Add to crafter.md:

```markdown
## ⚠️ NEVER USE cite_MISSING

The `{cite_MISSING}` pattern is NOT valid. If you need a citation:

1. **Use available citations** - Check the citation database first
2. **Mark for verification** - Use `[VERIFY]` if source is uncertain
3. **Rephrase** - Reword to avoid needing a missing citation
4. **Use general knowledge** - Some claims don't need citations

❌ NEVER: {cite_MISSING: description of needed source}
✅ CORRECT: Rephrase or use {cite_XXX} with [VERIFY]
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Zero `{cite_MISSING}` markers in output
- [ ] Claims either cited or appropriately hedged

## Summary

| Ticket | Issue | Severity |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 017 | Planning leakage | Critical |
| 018 | Metadata leakage | Critical |
| 019 | cite_MISSING markers | Critical |

These issues suggest the crafter prompt needs stronger "clean output" enforcement.
