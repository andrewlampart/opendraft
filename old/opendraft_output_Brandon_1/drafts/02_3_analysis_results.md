## 2.3 Analysis and Results

The analysis of the selected literature reveals a fundamental shift in video game localization paradigms, moving from linguistic equivalence to a complex interplay of "transcreation," technical asset management, and cultural negotiation. By synthesizing findings from foundational texts {cite_003}{cite_009} and recent case studies {cite_006}{cite_038}, this section presents the results of the narrative review. The findings are categorized into four primary dimensions: the operationalization of transcreation in character development, the technical integration of deep learning and asset generation, the semiotic analysis of multimodal elements, and the ethical implications of accessibility and representation.

### 2.3.1 The Operationalization of Transcreation and Communicative Strategies

The most consistent finding across the analyzed literature is the inadequacy of traditional translation theories to address the interactive nature of video games. The results indicate that "transcreation"—a term solidified in game studies by O'Hagan and Mangiron {cite_003}—has become the standard operating procedure for high-fidelity localization. This approach prioritizes the "playability" and emotional experience of the target audience over semantic fidelity to the source text.

#### 2.3.1.1 Character Voice and Dialogue Reconstruction
Recent case studies demonstrate that transcreation is particularly critical in the localization of character dialogue and personality. Wang's analysis of *Stardew Valley* {cite_006} provides empirical evidence of this strategy. The study reveals that direct translation of character dialogue often results in a "flattening" of personality traits, particularly for characters designed with specific socio-cultural markers. To maintain the "rural charm" and specific interpersonal dynamics of the game, translators employed communicative translation strategies that altered the literal meaning of sentences to preserve the illocutionary force—the intended function of the speech act.

Similarly, the analysis of *Black Myth: Wukong* by Wang {cite_038} highlights the tension between preserving cultural authenticity and ensuring communicative clarity for a global audience. As a game deeply rooted in Chinese mythology (specifically *Journey to the West*), the localization team faced the challenge of translating archaic terms and Buddhist concepts. The findings suggest that a "communicative translation" approach was favored, where cultural specificities were often explicated or adapted to ensure that the narrative beat landed with Western players, even if it meant sacrificing some degree of philological precision.

Table 1 summarizes the comparative analysis of translation strategies found in the literature, contrasting the approaches used in different genres.

| Strategy | Focus | Case Study Example | Outcome |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Domestication** | Fluency for target culture | *Stardew Valley* {cite_006} | Enhanced immersion; loss of source nuances |
| **Foreignization** | Preserving source otherness | *Black Myth: Wukong* {cite_038} | Retained cultural identity; higher cognitive load |
| **Transcreation** | Creating new content | *Arena of Valor* {cite_011} | Complete asset replacement for market appeal |
| **Communicative** | Message function over form | General Industry {cite_003} | Prioritizes "fun factor" and playability |

*Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Translation Strategies in Selected Literature.*

The dichotomy between domestication and foreignization, a classic debate in translation studies exemplified by literary comparisons such as Cao's analysis of *Biancheng* {cite_017}, is recontextualized in video games. While literary translation often debates the ethics of erasing the source culture, game localization results suggest that the commercial imperative of "immersion" drives a stronger tendency toward domestication or total transcreation. However, *Black Myth: Wukong* represents a counter-trend identified in the data: the rise of "cultural export" games where the foreignness of the setting is a primary selling point, necessitating a strategy that balances accessibility with exoticism {cite_038}.

#### 2.3.1.2 Humor and Cultural Realia
Moreno García's investigation into *Arena of Valor* {cite_011} provides significant data on the handling of "cultural realia"—objects, myths, or concepts specific to a culture. The analysis reveals that mobile MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) games often resort to extreme transcreation, effectively replacing entire characters or skins to match the target market's cultural expectations. For instance, a character based on Chinese folklore might be visually and narratively overhauled to resemble a Western fantasy archetype for the European release. This goes beyond textual translation into the realm of "cultural engineering," where the product is fundamentally altered to maximize market penetration.

### 2.3.2 Technical Constraints and Automated Workflows

The results of the literature review indicate that technical constraints remain a defining characteristic of game localization, distinguishing it from other audiovisual translation modes. However, the nature of these constraints has evolved from simple storage limitations to complex issues regarding asset generation and neural network integration.

#### 2.3.2.1 From Text to Asset Generation
A critical finding from Ribeiro et al. {cite_010} is that modern localization is increasingly concerned with non-textual assets. The systematic review of deep learning applications in games reveals that "asset generation" is no longer limited to procedural terrain but extends to the localization of graphical user interfaces (GUI) and in-game textures. Deep learning models are now capable of generating image-based assets that adapt to the target language.

For example, if a sign in a game world reads "STOP" in English, traditional localization might rely on subtitles or leave the graphic untranslated due to the high cost of re-rendering textures. Ribeiro et al. {cite_010} demonstrate that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and other deep learning architectures can automate the creation of localized textures, allowing the sign to read "ARRÊT" in French or "PARE" in Spanish with the same visual style and weathering effects as the original. This represents a significant leap in "deep localization," reducing the friction between the diegetic world and the localized interface.

#### 2.3.2.2 Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Multimodality
The integration of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) into game workflows is another key theme. Aytaş {cite_019} presents data on the efficacy of "multimodal" NMT systems. Traditional machine translation engines process text in isolation, often leading to context errors (e.g. Translating the noun "Tank" as a verb or a container, rather than the military vehicle or RPG class). Aytaş's research indicates that integrating visual and auditory modalities—feeding the NMT model screenshots or audio clips associated with the text segment—significantly improves translation quality.

This finding is corroborated by Sun et al. {cite_027}, who explore cross-modal contrastive learning. While their work focuses on audio-visual event localization, the underlying principle applies to game localization: the meaning of a game asset is constructed through the convergence of sound, image, and text. Automated systems that ignore this multimodal context fail to achieve the "functional equivalence" required by the industry.

Table 2 presents the technical challenges identified in the literature and the corresponding AI-driven solutions currently emerging in the field.

| Challenge | Technical Constraint | Emerging Solution | Citation |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Context Loss** | Text strings lack visual context | Multimodal NMT (Visual/Audio input) | {cite_019} |
| **Texture Lock** | Hard-coded text in images | Deep Learning Asset Generation | {cite_010} |
| **Workflow Speed** | Live service update frequency | Automated Subtitling Systems | {cite_044} |
| **Testing** | Infinite branching narratives | Automated Software Testing Standards | {cite_045} |

### 2.3.3 Semiotic Analysis and Multimodal Cohesion

Moving beyond the text, the analysis of semiotic systems in video games reveals that meaning is often encoded in non-verbal signs that require interpretation and localization. Bagaskara and Dhanadipa's study of *Elden Ring* {cite_026} provides a rigorous semiotic analysis of visual signs in boss cutscenes.

#### 2.3.3.1 Visual Narratives and Environmental Storytelling
The findings from *Elden Ring* suggest that narrative delivery in modern "Souls-like" games relies heavily on visual semiotics—costume design, lighting, character positioning, and environmental debris—rather than explicit dialogue {cite_026}. For the localizer, this presents a unique challenge: the text must anchor the ambiguity of the visual signs without over-explaining them. The analysis shows that successful localization in this genre often involves "minimalist" translation strategies that preserve the interpretative gap intended by the developers.

This connects to the broader concept of "inter-semiotic translation" discussed in the theoretical literature. When Chepelyuk et al. {cite_033} analyze the internal organization of discourse in games, they find that the "text" is merely one layer of a polyphonic system. If the visual channel conveys aggression (red colors, sharp angles), the localized text must align with that affective register. Incongruence between the visual sign (universal) and the verbal sign (localized) leads to a breakdown in player immersion, a phenomenon often described by players as "bad writing" but identified in the analysis as "semiotic dissonance."

#### 2.3.3.2 Audio-Visual Synchronization and Dubbing
The challenges of dubbing are further explored by Mejías-Climent {cite_025}, who analyzes dubbing through game situations. Unlike film dubbing, where linear timing is fixed, game dubbing must account for dynamic triggers. The analysis reveals that "isochrony" (matching the duration of the spoken phrase) is more critical in games than lip-syncing, due to the programmable nature of dialogue windows. However, in cinematic cutscenes, the expectations match film standards. Saralegi et al. {cite_044} discuss the development of automatic multilingual subtitling and dubbing systems, noting that while automation can handle timing (spotting), the prosodic adaptation required for emotional resonance remains a human-centric task.

### 2.3.4 Cultural Adaptation and Regulatory Compliance

The results of the review highlight that localization is frequently a tool for market access, subject to strict political and cultural regulations. This is most evident in the analysis of the Chinese market.

#### 2.3.4.1 The "Journey to the East" Paradigm
Dong and Mangiron {cite_029} provide extensive data on the adaptation of Western games for China. Their findings, titled "Journey to the East," outline a systematic process of "sanitization" and "cultural harmonization." Key data points include the removal of skeletons and blood to comply with Chinese Ministry of Culture regulations, and the modification of political narratives that might be construed as sensitive.

This regulatory landscape necessitates a form of "preventive localization," where developers alter assets during the production phase to avoid bans. The analysis draws a parallel here to historical forms of censorship, such as those described by Bates {cite_028} regarding state monopolies on information in Poland (1976-1989). While the context differs, the mechanism—state-controlled access to cultural products dictating the content of those products—remains a consistent structural force. In the game industry, this results in "regional builds" of software, where the game played in Shanghai differs visually and narratively from the version played in New York.

#### 2.3.4.2 Economic Implications and Market Strategy
The economic driver behind these adaptations is substantial. As noted in the literature regarding the Turkish game industry {cite_014}, the disruption of mobile technologies has globalized the revenue streams for even small developers. Consequently, the "localization ROI" (Return on Investment) calculation determines the depth of adaptation. Roomberg {cite_036} touches upon the financial complexities of the industry, including money laundering risks in virtual economies, which adds another layer to localization: the translation and adaptation of legal terms, monetization schemes, and currency formats must meet diverse international financial regulations.

Table 3 synthesizes the levels of cultural adaptation identified in the analysis, ranging from superficial translation to deep regulatory modification.

| Level | Description | Examples from Literature | Primary Driver |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Surface** | Text/UI translation only | Indie games (limited budget) | Cost-efficiency |
| **Cultural** | Adaptation of humor/names | *Stardew Valley* {cite_006} | Immersion/Playability |
| **Deep** | Asset replacement (skins/maps) | *Arena of Valor* {cite_011} | Market appeal |
| **Regulatory** | Censorship/Compliance | Chinese Market adaptations {cite_029} | Legal access |

*Table 3: Hierarchy of Cultural Adaptation and Regulatory Compliance.*

### 2.3.5 Accessibility and Ethical Considerations

The final dimension of the analysis concerns the ethical expansion of localization to include accessibility features, effectively "localizing" the game for players with disabilities.

#### 2.3.5.1 Audio Description and Universal Design
Larreina and Mangiron {cite_008} present findings on the implementation of Audio Description (AD) in video games. Historically, AD was a post-production addition for linear media. However, the analysis shows that in games, AD must be integrated into the game engine itself to react to player agency. The results indicate that "accessible localization" is becoming a standard quality metric. Westin {cite_049} supports this by surveying engine-independent solutions for large-scale accessibility, arguing that accessibility features should be treated as a form of "intralingual localization"—translating visual data into audio data for blind players, or audio data into haptic/visual data for deaf players.

#### 2.3.5.2 Therapeutic and Serious Games
The analysis of therapeutic games by Jeanmaire and Kim {cite_021} introduces a vital ethical nuance. When localizing games designed for medical purposes (e.g. Asthma management for children), the "transcreation" liberty is constrained by clinical accuracy. The findings show that the translator must balance "medical vulgarisation" (making complex terms understandable to children) with strict adherence to medical protocols. An error in translating a dosage instruction or a symptom description in a therapeutic game carries real-world health risks, unlike a mistranslation in a fantasy RPG. This necessitates a collaborative workflow involving medical professionals, distinct from the typical entertainment localization pipeline.

#### 2.3.5.3 Gender and Production Culture
Finally, the analysis of production culture by Jacobs-Johnson {cite_020} reveals the gendered dimensions of the industry that indirectly affect localization. The "crunch culture" and male-dominated environments often result in source texts that reflect specific biases. Localizers, often acting as cultural mediators, may attempt to "soften" or "correct" gender stereotypes present in the source material during the translation process. This act of "ethical intervention" is a recurring theme in the results, suggesting that localizers view themselves not just as conduits of text, but as stewards of representation.

### 2.3.6 Synthesis of Findings

The integration of these diverse findings paints a picture of video game localization as a highly technical, ethically complex, and culturally stratified practice. The literature confirms that the GILT framework (Globalization, Internationalization, Localization, Translation) described by O'Hagan and Mangiron {cite_003} is still relevant but has been complicated by the rise of AI {cite_010} and the fragmentation of global markets {cite_029}.

The analysis demonstrates that "quality" in game localization is no longer defined by linguistic accuracy alone. Instead, it is a composite metric comprising:
1. **Functional Equivalence:** Does the game play the same way? ({cite_003})
2. **Cultural Resonance:** Does the character feel authentic to the target culture? ({cite_006}, {cite_038})
3. **Technical Integration:** Do the assets (text, texture, audio) load and display correctly without breaking immersion? ({cite_010}, {cite_019})
4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Is the content legal in the target territory? ({cite_029})

These results provide a robust empirical basis for the discussion that follows, highlighting the tension between the creative aspirations of transcreation and the rigid constraints of code and capital.

### 2.3.7 Statistical Trends in Research Focus

While this review is narrative, a meta-analysis of the cited literature reveals shifting trends in research focus over the last decade. Early research {cite_001}{cite_035} focused heavily on terminology management and translator training. The middle period {cite_003}{cite_049} emphasized accessibility and the definition of the field. The most recent wave of research {cite_010}{cite_019}{cite_027} is dominated by the application of deep learning and neural networks to the localization pipeline.

Table 4 illustrates the thematic distribution of the analyzed sources, indicating the trajectory of the field.

| Research Era | Dominant Theme | Key Citations | Methodological Focus |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Foundational (2000-2013)** | Definitions, Training, Terminology | {cite_001}, {cite_003}, {cite_035} | Qualitative, Pedagogical |
| **Expansion (2014-2020)** | Cultural Adaptation, Mobile Markets | {cite_014}, {cite_029}, {cite_002} | Case Studies, Industry Analysis |
| **Technological (2021-2025)** | AI, Deep Learning, Multimodality | {cite_010}, {cite_019}, {cite_027} | Experimental, Computer Science |

*Table 4: Thematic Evolution of Game Localization Research.*

This trajectory suggests that the future of localization analysis will increasingly require interdisciplinary methodologies that combine translation studies with computer science and data analytics, a conclusion supported by the emergence of complex "meta-design models" for collaborative work {cite_050} and the rigorous formalization of software testing standards {cite_045}.

The results presented here underscore that video game localization has matured into a distinct industrial and academic discipline. The evidence from *Stardew Valley*, *Black Myth: Wukong*, and *Elden Ring* confirms that successful localization is a holistic process of "world re-engineering," where every semiotic layer—from the code to the cutscene—is subject to transformation.
