### Abstract
**Heading:** **Abstract** (Bold, Centered, No Chapter Number)
**Length:** 300-500 words
**Structure:**

2. **Problem:** Translation theory often treats games as static text, ignoring UI limits, iterative updates, and technical debt.
3. **Methodology:** Multimodal Comparative Analysis (ST-TT comparison, Technical Constraint Analysis, Sentiment Analysis) of *Helldivers 2*, *Valheim*, and *Empires of the Undergrowth*.
4. **Results:** Findings on how genre dictates strategy (e.g. Satire preservation vs. scientific accuracy).
5. **Conclusion:** Successful localization is a balance of technical management and community expectation, not just linguistic fidelity.

**Keywords:** *Game Localization, Technical Constraints, Player Reception, Multimodal Analysis, Games-as-a-Service (GaaS).*

## Chapter 1: Introduction
**Length:** ~2,500 words

### 1.1 Background and Context
- Evolution of the industry: From "Boxed Product" to "Live Service."
- The shift in localization roles: From post-production translation to simultaneous development.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
- Traditional translation theory (e.g., Skopos theory) is insufficient for modern technical realities.
- Current research focuses on linguistic equivalence, ignoring the "Why" (technical constraints) and the "So what?" (player reception).

### 1.3 Research Questions
1. **RQ1:** How do technical constraints (UI limits, character restrictions, update frequency) influence localization strategies in distinct game genres?
2. **RQ2:** To what extent do genre-specific requirements (satire, historical immersion, scientific accuracy) dictate the prioritization of translation strategies?
3. **RQ3:** How do these strategies impact player immersion and narrative integrity as measured by community reception?

### 1.4 Methodology Overview
- Brief introduction to the Multimodal Comparative Analysis.
- Introduction of the corpus (*Helldivers 2, Valheim, Empires of the Undergrowth*).

### 1.5 Thesis Structure
- Roadmap of the subsequent chapters.

## Chapter 2: Literature Review
**Length:** ~5,000 words

### 2.1 Game Localization Theory
- **Historical Overview:** From Bernal-Merino to O'Hagan (2013).
- **GILT:** Globalization, Internationalization, Localization, Translation.
- **The "Playability" Concept:** Functionalist approaches to game translation.

### 2.2 Technical Constraints in Localization
- **UI and Space:** Character limitations, text expansion ratios, and variable management.
- **Development Models:** Waterfall vs. Agile in localization workflows.
- **The GaaS Challenge:** Continuous localization and version control issues.

### 2.3 Reception Studies in Gaming
- Measuring "Immersion" and "Flow" in translated games.
- The role of community feedback (Steam reviews, Reddit, Discord) in shaping localization patches.

### 2.4 Gap Analysis
- Lack of studies triangulating *technical code constraints* with *player sentiment*.

## Chapter 3: Methodology
**Length:** ~3,000 words

### 3.1 Research Design
- **Multimodal Comparative Analysis:** Framework definition.

### 3.2 Corpus Selection
**Table 1:** Corpus Specifications
| Game Title | Genre | Engine/Tech | Key Challenge |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| *Helldivers 2* | Co-op Shooter / GaaS | Stingray (Modified) | Satire, Speed, Dynamic Updates |
| *Valheim* | Survival / Sandbox | Unity | Cultural Lexicon, Early Access |
| *Empires of the Undergrowth* | RTS / Simulation | Unreal Engine 4 | Scientific Terminology, UI Density |

### 3.3 Data Collection Procedures
1. **Text Extraction:** Methods for extracting ST (English) and TT (Target Languages) assets.
2. **Constraint Identification:** Analyzing UI boxes, character limits, and font capabilities.
3. **Reception Data:** Scraping Steam reviews and Reddit threads focusing on localization keywords (e.g., "translation," "dub," "text," "mistake").

### 3.4 Analytical Framework
- **Taxonomy of Errors:** Distinguishing between *Linguistic Errors* (mistranslation) vs. *Technical Compromises* (abbreviations due to space).

## Quality Checklist for Crafter Agents

### ⚠️ TABLE & FIGURE NUMBERING (CRITICAL)
- **Global Numbering:** Ensure Table 1 is not repeated. If Table 1 is in Ch 3, the first table in Ch 5 must be Table 2 (or Table 3, etc.).
- **Captions:** All figures must have APA style captions *below* the image. All tables must have captions *above* the table.

### Tone and Style
- **Voice:** Maintain an objective, analytical tone. Avoid "gamer slang" unless quoting a source or defining a term.
- **Verification:** Do not invent UI constraints. If exact character limits are unknown, use phrases like "visual inspection suggests a limit of approx. 20 characters."

### Reference Auto-Check
```
Action: Ensure all game titles are italicized (e.g., *Valheim*).
Action: Ensure all in-text citations have a corresponding reference entry.
```
