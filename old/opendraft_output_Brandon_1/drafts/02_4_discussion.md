# 2.4 Discussion

The synthesis of research findings presented in Section 2.3 reveals a dynamic and rapidly maturing field that has fundamentally outgrown its origins as a sub-discipline of technical translation. By integrating the theoretical frameworks established in the literature review (Section 2.1) with the thematic and chronological trends identified in the results (Section 2.3), this discussion interprets the current state of video game localization. The analysis indicates a paradigm shift from linguistic equivalence to "world re-engineering," driven by the dual pressures of technological advancement—specifically artificial intelligence—and the increasing demand for deep cultural adaptation in globalized markets.

This section interprets these findings through four primary lenses: the evolution of transcreation strategies, the impact of AI on the localization pipeline, the rise of multimodality and semiotics, and the professionalization of the industry. Furthermore, it addresses the research gaps identified in Section 2.1 regarding the lack of empirical reception studies and outlines future directions for the discipline.

## 2.4.1 The Evolution of Transcreation: From Text to Cultural Experience

As discussed in Section 2.1, the theoretical foundation of game localization has long rested on O'Hagan and Mangiron’s concept of "transcreation" {cite_003}, which prioritizes the player's experience over strict semantic fidelity. The results from Section 2.3 confirm that this theoretical model has not only persisted but has intensified in scope. The literature analyzed suggests that modern localization strategies now encompass a holistic reshaping of the game's cultural identity, a process that transcends the text to influence character design, narrative structure, and even game mechanics.

### 2.4.1.1 Strategies of Domestication and Foreignization
The dichotomy between domestication (adapting content to the target culture) and foreignization (preserving the source culture's otherness), a central tenet of translation theory discussed in Section 2.1, remains a critical strategic choice in video game localization. The case studies identified in the literature, particularly *Stardew Valley* {cite_006} and *Black Myth: Wukong* {cite_038}, illustrate how developers and localizers navigate this spectrum.

Research by Wang {cite_006} on *Stardew Valley* demonstrates a strong inclination towards domestication in character development. The findings indicate that to recreate character personalities effectively for a Chinese audience, translators often employ "communicative translation" strategies that modify dialogue to fit target-culture social norms. This aligns with the "Skopos theory" mentioned in early literature {cite_001}, where the purpose of the translation (entertainment and immersion) dictates the method. In *Stardew Valley*, the "world re-engineering" is subtle, focusing on interpersonal dynamics and linguistic politeness strategies that resonate with local players, thereby reducing the cognitive load required to understand foreign social cues.

Conversely, the analysis of *Black Myth: Wukong* by Wang {cite_038} presents a compelling counter-narrative favoring foreignization. As a title deeply rooted in Chinese mythology (specifically *Journey to the West*), the localization strategy prioritizes the preservation of cultural authenticity over ease of access. This approach challenges the traditional industry wisdom noted in Section 2.1, which often advocated for the removal of "cultural odors" to ensure global appeal. The success of such titles suggests a market shift where global players increasingly value "cultural tourism" within games. The localization process here becomes an act of cultural export, requiring translators to function as cultural mediators who explain, rather than erase, the source culture's specificities.

Table 5 summarizes the strategic divergence observed in the analyzed literature, contrasting the approaches of domestication and foreignization across different game genres.

| Feature | Domestication Strategy | Foreignization Strategy | Implication for Immersion |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Primary Goal** | Fluency and immediate relatability | Cultural authenticity and education | High comfort vs. High curiosity |
| **Character Voice** | Adapted to target culture norms | Retains source culture idiosyncrasies | Familiarity vs. Exoticism |
| **Cultural Realia** | Replaced with local equivalents | Retained with context/glossaries | Seamlessness vs. Learning curve |
| **Key Example** | *Stardew Valley* {cite_006} | *Black Myth: Wukong* {cite_038} | Genre-dependent expectations |
| **Theoretical Basis** | Communicative Translation | Source-Oriented Preservation | {cite_017}, {cite_029} |

*Table 5: Comparative Analysis of Localization Strategies in Recent Case Studies.*

The implications of this divergence are significant. The literature suggests that "transcreation" is no longer a monolithic concept but a flexible continuum. The choice between domestication and foreignization is increasingly dictated by the genre and the specific "value proposition" of the game. For casual simulation games like *Stardew Valley*, the value lies in relaxation and familiarity, necessitating domestication. For mythic action-RPGs like *Black Myth: Wukong*, the value lies in the exploration of a specific cultural fantasy, necessitating foreignization. This nuance refines the broad definitions provided in the foundational texts {cite_003} and addresses the "one size fits all" limitation of early localization models.

### 2.4.1.2 Cultural Adaptation in Asian Markets
The literature highlights the Asian market, particularly China, as a critical arena for localization studies. Dong and Mangiron {cite_029} emphasize that entering the Chinese market requires rigorous cultural adjustments that go beyond translation. This includes navigating regulatory landscapes and censorship {cite_028}, as well as adapting to specific gamer expectations regarding monetization and aesthetics.

The findings synthesized in Section 2.3 regarding mobile markets {cite_014} further corroborate the necessity of hyper-localization. In mobile gaming, where session times are short and user retention is precarious, any cultural friction can lead to churn. Therefore, the "world re-engineering" in mobile titles often involves aggressive adaptation of UI, color schemes, and monetization models to fit local habits. This contrasts with the console/PC market, where players may be more willing to engage with foreign cultural concepts. The literature indicates that successful localization in these regions is not merely linguistic but requires a "cultural audit" of the entire software product.

## 2.4.2 The Technological Turn: AI and Deep Learning Integration

One of the most profound findings from the literature analysis in Section 2.3 is the rapid integration of artificial intelligence and deep learning into the localization workflow. This trend represents a significant evolution from the "Computer-Assisted Translation" (CAT) tools discussed in the early literature {cite_035}. The current research landscape {cite_010}{cite_019}{cite_027} suggests that technology is shifting from a supportive role to a generative one.

### 2.4.2.1 From Text Processing to Asset Generation
The systematic review by Ribeiro et al. {cite_010} marks a critical turning point in how localization assets are conceived. While traditional localization focused on text strings, modern deep learning techniques enable the generation and modification of image-based assets. This capability allows for "deep localization" where visual elements—textures, sprites, and UI components—can be automatically adapted to target locales. For instance, street signs in an open-world game could be visually rewritten by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to match the target language, maintaining visual consistency without manual re-texturing by artists.

This technological advancement addresses a long-standing bottleneck identified in Section 2.1: the disconnect between linguistic translation and visual context. Historically, translators often worked in "blind" environments (Excel sheets), leading to context errors. The emergence of "Listen With Seeing" frameworks {cite_027} and cross-modal contrastive learning suggests a future where localization tools are context-aware, analyzing both audio and visual tracks to propose more accurate translations. This multimodal approach aligns with Aytaş’s findings {cite_019} on enhancing Neural Machine Translation (NMT) with visual modalities, proving that providing visual context to AI models significantly reduces ambiguity and improves translation quality.

### 2.4.2.2 Automation vs. Creativity
Despite the promise of AI, the literature reveals a tension between automation and creative agency. While Saralegi et al. {cite_044} demonstrate the feasibility of automatic multilingual subtitling and dubbing systems, questions remain regarding the aesthetic quality of such outputs. The "human-in-the-loop" model remains the gold standard, particularly for narrative-heavy titles.

However, the trajectory is clear. As noted in Table 4 (Section 2.3), the research focus has shifted decisively toward computer science and engineering methodologies. This implies that the future localizer will need to possess not only linguistic and cultural competence but also "technological literacy" to interact with NMT engines, post-edit AI outputs, and manage complex asset-generation pipelines. This validates the early predictions by Bernal-Merino {cite_001} regarding the changing nature of translator training, though the pace of technological change has likely outstripped the curricula of many training programs {cite_002}.

## 2.4.3 Multimodality and Semiotics in Game Narratives

The results in Section 2.3 highlight that video games are multimodal semiotic systems, where meaning is constructed through the interplay of text, image, sound, and gameplay mechanics. The discussion in Section 2.1 established that translating games requires attention to all these semiotic channels. The analyzed literature confirms this, offering detailed investigations into how non-verbal signs contribute to the localization process.

### 2.4.3.1 Visual Semiotics and Environmental Storytelling
Bagaskara and Dhanadipa’s analysis of *Elden Ring* {cite_026} provides empirical evidence of how visual signs function as narrative devices. In "Souls-like" games, where explicit dialogue is sparse, the environment itself tells the story. Localization, therefore, involves interpreting these visual cues. If a visual sign relies on a cultural metaphor specific to the source culture (e.g. A specific color representing death), the localization team must decide whether to alter the texture (visual localization) or rely on text to bridge the gap.

The literature suggests that "world re-engineering" often fails when visual semiotics are ignored. For example, Moreno García {cite_011} discusses the adaptation of "cultural realia" in *Arena of Valor*. The success of the localization depends on whether the visual representation of heroes and items aligns with the target culture's semiotic expectations. When there is a mismatch—such as a visual symbol that connotes bravery in the source culture but aggression in the target culture—the "textual" translation cannot fully compensate. This underscores the need for "multimodal localization," where the visual and auditory channels are treated with the same rigor as the linguistic channel.

### 2.4.3.2 Accessibility as Localization
A significant sub-theme emerging from the literature is the convergence of localization and accessibility. Research by Larreina and Mangiron {cite_008} and Westin {cite_049} positions accessibility features (such as audio descriptions and closed captions) as forms of "intra-lingual localization." Just as localization translates a game for a different linguistic community, accessibility translates the game experience for a different sensory community.

The integration of these fields is driven by shared technologies. The same text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) technologies used for automated dubbing {cite_044} are utilized for screen readers. Furthermore, the "Listen With Seeing" framework {cite_027} has direct applications in generating automated audio descriptions for visually impaired players. This convergence suggests a broader definition of the field: "User Experience (UX) Adaptation," where the goal is to remove barriers to entry, whether those barriers are linguistic, cultural, or physical.

## 2.4.4 Professionalization and Standardization

The maturation of the field is further evidenced by the shift from ad-hoc practices to formal standardization. As noted in Section 2.1, early game localization was often characterized by "rom-hacking" and fan translations. The literature analyzed in Section 2.3 paints a picture of a highly regulated industrial sector.

### 2.4.4.1 Standards and Process Models
The work by Ali and Yue {cite_045} on formalizing software testing standards (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119) is indicative of this maturity. Localization testing (LQA) is no longer a casual playthrough but a rigorous engineering process designed to detect linguistic and cosmetic defects. This formalization is necessary to support the scale of modern "AAA" development.

Additionally, the emergence of "meta-design models" for collaborative work {cite_050} addresses the complexity of distributed localization teams. With translators, editors, testers, and engineers working across different time zones, the "waterfall" models of the past have given way to agile and continuous delivery workflows. This industrial rigor stands in contrast to the "hacker" origins of the field discussed by Pachali {cite_048}, marking the definitive transition of game localization into a corporate engineering discipline.

### 2.4.4.2 Ethical and Legal Dimensions
As the industry scales, new challenges emerge. Roomberg {cite_036} raises the issue of money laundering in the video game industry, highlighting the complex financial ecosystems that localizers must now understand. Virtual economies, loot boxes, and microtransactions vary significantly in legality across regions (e.g., Belgium vs. China). Localization teams are increasingly responsible for ensuring that the game's monetization mechanics comply with local laws, adding a legal dimension to the "world re-engineering" process. This extends the scope of the localizer's responsibility beyond the text to the very economic structure of the game.

## 2.4.5 Addressing the Research Gap: The Need for Reception Studies

While the analyzed literature provides a robust understanding of *how* games are localized (strategies) and *with what tools* (technologies), a critical gap remains regarding *how players perceive* these efforts. As identified in the gap analysis in Section 2.1, the field is heavily skewed toward product-oriented analysis (comparing source and target texts) and process-oriented analysis (workflows and tools).

### 2.4.5.1 The Absence of the Player
There is a notable scarcity of empirical reception studies in the dataset. While studies like Wang {cite_006} analyze the strategies used in *Stardew Valley*, they do not present data on whether Chinese players *preferred* the domesticated character personalities over the original ones. Similarly, while we know that AI can generate assets {cite_010}, we lack longitudinal data on player acceptance of AI-generated content versus human-crafted content.

The bibliometric anomalies discussed by Meho {cite_043} and the questions of digital value raised by Aimo {cite_034} suggest that the academic metrics may be incentivizing volume of publication over deep, longitudinal user research. To fully understand the impact of "world re-engineering," future research must pivot toward reception studies that utilize eye-tracking, sentiment analysis, and large-scale A/B testing to measure the actual efficacy of localization strategies.

Table 6 outlines the implications of the current literature landscape and identifies specific trajectories for future inquiry based on the analyzed texts.

| Dimension | Current State (Literature Findings) | Identified Gap | Future Research Trajectory |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Methodology** | Comparative Text Analysis; System Design | Lack of empirical player data | Reception studies using biometrics/surveys |
| **Technology** | AI for asset generation & NMT | Quality perception of AI output | Human-AI interaction in creative workflows |
| **Culture** | Focus on East-West adaptation | Under-represented locales (Africa/LatAm) | South-South localization dynamics |
| **Scope** | Text and Audio | Holistic/Multimodal cohesion | Impact of visual localization on immersion |
| **Theory** | Transcreation & Skopos | Cognitive load of localization | Psycholinguistic analysis of gaming |

## 2.4.6 Conclusion of Discussion

The discussion of the literature reveals that video game localization has evolved into a sophisticated, interdisciplinary field that sits at the intersection of translation studies, software engineering, and cultural anthropology. The findings from Section 2.3 validate the theoretical framework of "transcreation" established in Section 2.1 but extend it into the realm of "world re-engineering."

The evidence from the cited studies {cite_006}{cite_038}{cite_026} confirms that successful localization requires the manipulation of semiotic layers far deeper than the linguistic surface. Whether through the domestication of character personalities in *Stardew Valley*, the preservation of mythic authenticity in *Black Myth: Wukong*, or the semiotic decoding of *Elden Ring*, localizers are engaged in the reconstruction of virtual worlds.

However, the field faces a "technological event horizon" with the advent of deep learning {cite_010}. The integration of AI threatens to disrupt traditional workflows, potentially commodifying the localization process while simultaneously offering new tools for multimodal adaptation. As the industry continues to professionalize and standardize {cite_045}, the role of the localizer is transforming from a translator of text to a cultural engineer and technical operator.

The most pressing challenge for future research, as indicated by the gaps in the current literature, is to empirically validate these strategies through player reception studies. Only by understanding the cognitive and emotional impact of localization choices can the field move from descriptive analysis to predictive modeling of player experience. The trajectory suggests that the next decade of research will be defined not by *how* we translate, but by *how players feel* about the translated worlds they inhabit.
