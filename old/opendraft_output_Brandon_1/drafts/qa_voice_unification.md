## Voice Profile

**Recommended Voice for This Thesis:**
- **Tone:** Academic, analytical, authoritative yet nuanced.
- **Person:** **Third Person** ("This thesis," "This research"). Avoid "we" unless referring to humanity in general (and even then, be careful).
- **Tense:**
 - *Intro/Discussion/Conclusion:* Present (what the thesis *does*).
 - *Lit Review:* Present (what the literature *says* - e.g., "Smith argues").
 - *Methods:* Present (for narrative reviews/theoretical frameworks).
- **Formality:** High. Vocabulary is sophisticated (e.g., "hermeneutic synthesis," "operationalization").

## Issues Found

### 1. Person Inconsistency (The "We" Slip)
While the text is 99% consistent in using "This research" or "The study," there is a slip into the first person in the Discussion.

* **Location:** Section 2.4 Discussion, last paragraph.
* **Current:** "...defined not by *how we translate*, but by *how players feel*..."
* **Issue:** "We" implies the author and the reader, or the author and the industry. It breaks the objective distance established earlier.
* **Fix:** "...defined not by **translation mechanics**, but by **player emotional resonance**..."

### 2. Colloquial Phrasing
The text is generally high-register, but a few phrases are slightly too casual for the surrounding academic context.

* **Location:** Section 2.4 Discussion, last paragraph.
* **Current:** "...how players **feel about** the translated worlds..."
* **Issue:** "Feel about" is conversational.
* **Fix:** "...player **affective response to** the translated worlds..." or "...**emotional engagement with**..."

* **Location:** Section 2.1 Literature Review.
* **Current:** "...did really well..." (Hypothetical check based on common errors - *Note: The provided text actually says "surpassing the revenue," which is good. If "did really well" appears in the full hidden text, change to "achieved strong commercial performance".*)

### 3. Dramatic Metaphor
* **Location:** Section 2.4 Discussion, paragraph 3.
* **Current:** "...field faces a 'technological event horizon'..."
* **Issue:** While evocative, "event horizon" is a physics metaphor that might be considered slightly too dramatic/journalistic for a strict thesis unless it is a direct quote from a source.
* **Fix:** If this is your metaphor: "...field faces a **critical technological inflection point**..."
* **Fix:** If this is a cited metaphor: Ensure the citation follows immediately (e.g., "...'technological event horizon' {cite_010}...").

### 4. Document Type Terminology
* **Status:** ✅ **Excellent.**
* **Observation:** You correctly use "This thesis," "Chapter," and "Section." You avoided "This paper" or "This article."
* **Action:** Maintain this strict discipline.

### 5. Incomplete Sentences (Drafting Error)
* **Location:** End of Intro, End of Methodology (2.2.1), End of Analysis (2.3.1), End of Conclusion.
* **Issue:** The text cuts off mid-sentence (e.g., "The following sections outline th", "The results").
* **Action:** Ensure these are completed before final proofreading.

## Sentence Structure & Vocabulary

**Vocabulary Level:** **High/Appropriate.**
* Terms like "GILT framework," "gameplay gestalt," "hermeneutic synthesis," and "semiotic layers" are excellent and precise.

**Repetition Check:**
* **"Shift" / "Transition":** You use "shift from linguistic equivalence to transcreation" multiple times (Intro, Lit Review, Analysis, Discussion).
 * *Recommendation:* This is your core argument, so repetition is acceptable, but try varying the verb: "evolution," "paradigm change," "trajectory," "metamorphosis."

## Recommended Voice Adjustments

### Apply these specific edits to unify the voice:

**1. Discussion Section (Refining the closing statement):**
> **Original:** "The trajectory suggests that the next decade of research will be defined not by *how we translate*, but by *how players feel* about the translated worlds they inhabit."
>
> **Revised:** "The trajectory suggests that the next decade of research will be defined not by **procedural translation methodologies**, but by **the reception and affective experience of players within** these translated worlds."

**2. Methodology Section (Ensuring objective framing):**
> **Original:** "...this research maintains an ethical stance that avoids assigning individual blame..."
>
> **Revised:** "...this research **adopts** an ethical stance that **precludes** assigning individual blame..." (Slightly stronger academic verbs).

**3. Table Captions:**
> **Original:** "Source: Author's synthesis of literature."
>
> **Revised:** "Source: Synthesis of literature." (In a thesis, "Author" is redundant as you are the sole author, but "Author's synthesis" is acceptable if your institution requires it. "Synthesis of literature" is cleaner).

## Verification Checklist for Next Iteration

1. **Search for "we" / "I" / "our":** Ensure they only appear in direct quotes.
2. **Search for "paper" / "article":** Ensure they only refer to *other* people's work, not your thesis.
3. **Check Tense in Results:** Ensure you don't slip into Past Tense for the literature ("Smith **found** that...") vs Present Tense for your analysis ("This thesis **finds** that..."). Keep your analysis in the Present tense for a narrative review.
