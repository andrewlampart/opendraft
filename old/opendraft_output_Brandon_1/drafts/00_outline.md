## Core Argument Flow

**Draft Statement:**
Current game localization research focuses too heavily on textual equivalence while ignoring the technical realities of modern game development (GaaS, UI limits) and actual player reception. By analyzing *Helldivers 2*, *Valheim*, and *Empires of the Undergrowth*, this thesis argues that "successful" localization is less about linguistic fidelity and more about managing technical constraints and community expectations within specific sub-genres.

**Logical Progression:**
1. **Problem:** Traditional translation theory (O'Hagan, 2013) predates Live Service models and treats games purely as text, ignoring technical UI limits and iterative updates.
2. **Lit Review:** Existing studies compare Source Text (ST) to Target Text (TT) but fail to ask *why* changes happened (cultural choice vs. character limit) or if players liked it.
3. **Methodology:** We adopt a **Multimodal Comparative Analysis** that triangulates ST-TT comparison, Technical Constraint Analysis (UI/LocKit), and Player Reception (Sentiment Analysis).
4. **Analysis:**
 * *Helldivers 2* reveals how GaaS demands speed over precision, relying on "satirical tone" preservation.
 * *Valheim* demonstrates the tension between "cultural exoticism" (Norse terms) and accessibility.
 * *Empires of the Undergrowth* highlights distinct terminological challenges in scientific/RTS contexts.
5. **Synthesis:** Effective strategies are genre-dependent; "errors" are often technical compromises or context-blindness, not linguistic failures.

## Thesis Structure

### 1. Title
**Suggested Title:** "Beyond Textual Equivalence: Analyzing Technical Constraints, Cultural Adaptation, and Player Reception in Video Game Localization"
**Alternative:** "Localization in the Age of Live Service: Strategies and Reception in *Helldivers 2*, *Valheim*, and *Empires of the Undergrowth*"

### 2. Abstract (300-500 words)
- **Context:** Evolution from boxed products to GaaS/Early Access.
- **Problem:** Gap between translation theory and technical reality; lack of reception studies.
- **Methodology:** Comparative case study of three distinct genres (GaaS Shooter, Survival Sandbox, RTS) using text analysis and player sentiment mining.
- **Findings:** Strategies shift from "fidelity" to "functionalism" based on genre; technical constraints dictate strategy more than cultural preference in UI-heavy games.
- **Implications:** Need for "Technical Awareness" in translation training and "LocKit" transparency in research.

### 3. Chapter 1: Introduction (2,500 words)
#### 1.1 Background
- The rise of the gaming industry and the necessity of localization.
- Distinction between "Translation," "Localization," and "Transcreation."
- Introduction of the selected games: *Helldivers 2* (Satire/GaaS), *Valheim* (Cultural/Indie), *Empires of the Undergrowth* (Niche/Scientific).

#### 1.2 Problem Statement
- **The "Context Blindness" Gap:** Research assumes translators see the game; reality is often spreadsheets.
- **The "Technical" Gap:** Text length limits (pixel width) often force "simplification" that researchers mistake for "cultural censorship."
- **The "Reception" Gap:** We know what changed, but not if players care.

#### 1.3 Research Questions
- **RQ1:** How do technical constraints (UI, character limits) influence translation strategies in the selected games?
- **RQ2:** To what extent are "Domestication" vs. "Foreignization" strategies used to maintain immersion in different genres?
- **RQ3:** How does player reception (via community feedback) correlate with these localization choices?

#### 1.4 Thesis Outline
- Roadmap of the 9 chapters.

### 4. Chapter 2: Literature Review (4,000 words)
#### 2.1 Theoretical Foundations
- **Skopos Theory (Vermeer):** Function over form.
- **Game Localization Theory (O'Hagan, Mangiron):** The concept of "Playability" as the ultimate goal.
- **Domestication vs. Foreignization (Venuti):** Bringing the game to the player vs. the player to the game.

#### 2.2 The Technical Turn
- Review of literature on "Internationalization" (i18n).
- Analysis of papers discussing variables, tags, and UI constraints.

#### 2.3 The Reception Gap
- Critique of current methodology: Why pure textual analysis is insufficient.
- Review of recent studies (e.g., Wang, 2025) and where they stop short (lack of player data).

### 5. Chapter 3: Methodology (2,500 words)
#### 3.1 Research Design
- **Qualitative-Quantitative Mixed Methods:**
 - Textual Analysis (Comparative)
 - Sentiment Analysis (Reception)

#### 3.2 Data Collection
- **Corpus Construction:**
 - Extraction of "Key Terms," "Dialogue," and "UI Text" from English (Source) and Target Languages (e.g., Spanish/German/Chinese - *User to specify target language*).
 - **Reception Data:** Steam Reviews, Reddit threads, and Official Discord bug reports related to localization.

#### 3.3 Analytical Framework
- **Taxonomy of Strategies:** Borrowing, Calque, Literal Translation, Transposition, Modulation, Adaptation.
- **Taxonomy of Errors:** Linguistic Error vs. Context Error (Blindness) vs. Technical Truncation.

### 6. Chapter 4: Case Study I - *Helldivers 2* (4,000 words)
**Focus: Satire, Live Service (GaaS), and Speed.**

#### 4.1 Context
- Fast-paced updates, community-driven narrative (The "Game Master").

#### 4.2 Textual Analysis
- **Strategy:** Handling "Super Earth" propaganda. How is the satirical tone preserved?
- **Technical:** Variable handling (e.g. Dynamic planet names in mission briefings).

#### 4.3 Reception Analysis
- Analysis of community reaction to specific localized terms (e.g., "Stratagems").
- Does the humor land in the target language?
- **Evidence:** Comparative table of humorous lines and player sentiment scores.

### 7. Chapter 5: Case Study II - *Valheim* (4,000 words)
**Focus: Cultural Specificity and "Foreignization".**

#### 5.1 Context
- Heavily rooted in Norse mythology. Early Access development cycle.

#### 5.2 Textual Analysis
- **Strategy:** Retention of Norse terms (Draugr, Fuling).
- **Analysis:** Is "Foreignization" used to enhance immersion?
- **Item Descriptions:** Analysis of "flavor text" and poetry vs. UI utility.

#### 5.3 Reception Analysis
- Do players in the target language feel the "Viking" atmosphere?
- Discussion of community translations (mods) vs. official localization.

### 8. Chapter 6: Case Study III - *Empires of the Undergrowth* (4,000 words)
**Focus: Scientific Terminology and Niche UI.**

#### 6.1 Context
- RTS genre with heavy entomological (insect science) vocabulary.

#### 6.2 Textual Analysis
- **Strategy:** Accuracy vs. Playability. Handling Latin names (Formica rufa) vs. common names.
- **Technical:** RTS UI is notoriously dense. Analysis of text expansion/contraction issues in tooltips.

#### 6.3 Reception Analysis
- Player feedback on clarity of mechanics explanations.
- Did localization errors lead to gameplay misunderstandings?

### 9. Chapter 7: Cross-Case Analysis & Discussion (3,000 words)
#### 9.1 The Role of Genre
- Comparison: How RTS demands differ from Shooters regarding "Immersion."
- *Helldivers 2* prioritizes **Tone**; *Empires* prioritizes **Clarity**; *Valheim* prioritizes **Atmosphere**.

#### 9.2 Technical vs. Cultural Constraints
- **Critical Finding:** Many "bad translations" identified in reviews are actually text-overflow issues (Technical) or variable errors (Context Blindness), not translator incompetence.

#### 9.3 The "Live" Factor
- How patches break localization (regression errors) in *Helldivers 2* vs. the static nature of older games.

### 10. Chapter 8: Conclusion (2,000 words)
#### 10.1 Summary of Findings

2. **Cultural Adaptation:**
 * *Fulfilled by:* Analysis of Norse mythology handling in *Valheim* (Domestication vs. Foreignization).
 * *Metric:* Categorization of cultural terms (Retained vs. Adapted).

3. **Player Reception:**
 * *Fulfilled by:* Mining Steam Reviews and Discord for keywords ("Translation," "Dub," "Text," "Mistake").
 * *Metric:* Sentiment score (Positive/Negative) associated with localization discussions.

## Writing Priorities for Thesis

1. **Define "Immersion":** You must clearly define what immersion means in *each* genre. In *Helldivers*, immersion is "buying into the satire." In *Valheim*, it's "feeling like a Viking." In *Empires*, it's "feeling like a scientist/commander."
2. **Visual Evidence:** A thesis on video games *must* include figures. Screenshots of the Source UI vs. Target UI are mandatory to prove "Technical Constraints."
3. **Distinguish the "Why":** When analyzing a translation change, always ask: "Did they change this because of culture, or because the text box was too small?"

## User Action Items
1. **Select Target Language:** The outline assumes English is the Source. You must specify the Target Language(s) (e.g., English -> Spanish, or English -> Polish) for the comparative analysis.
2. **Data Access:** Ensure you can access the game files or have sufficient screenshots/gameplay footage to analyze the text in both languages.
3. **Community Mining:** Begin scraping/collecting reviews from Steam/Discord immediately, filtering for keywords like "translation," "language," "localization," or "typo."
