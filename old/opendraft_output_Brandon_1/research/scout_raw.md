#### 8. A Study on Translation Strategies for Character Development in Video Games: Taking Stardew Valley as an Example
**Authors**: Wang
**Year**: 2025
**DOI**: 10.61173/hgkday13
**URL**: https://doi.org/10.61173/hgkday13

**Abstract**: This study takes the independent video game Stardew Valley as an example to explore the strategies and effects of translating the original English character dialogue into Chinese, with a focus on how translation serves to recreate character personalities and localize cultural contexts. Guided by the theories of functional equivalence and pragmatic translation, the study selects five representative characters with distinct styles (Shane, Abigail, George, Emily, and Haley) from the game. Through a dialogue comparison analysis method, the study evaluates aspects such as tone, speech style, emotional expression, and cultural adaptation. The study found that translators retained the original personalities while adopting moderate stylistic adjustments and cultural softening strategies, achieving good functional equivalence. However, the simplification of language style for some characters also led to a dilution of their individuality. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of game character translation practices and provides case references for game localization work.

**DOI**: 10.54254/2753-7064/6/20230288
**URL**: https://doi.org/10.54254/2753-7064/6/20230288

**Abstract**: Biancheng, translated as Green Jade, Border Town, The Border Town, The Frontier City, is a masterpiece of Chinese contemporary writer Shen Congwen that has enjoyed a worldwide reputation since its publication in 1934. Among the translations of the masterpiece, the versions of Gladys Yangs and Kinkleys are more praised and influential. Hence, by making a comparative analysis of Gladys Yangs and Kinkleys versions from the perspective of domestication and foreignization, this article aims to discuss how the two versions differ in translation strategies and translation methods. Through the analysis, it is found that Yang tends to apply the domestication strategy while Kinkley prefers to adopt the foreignization strategy. Meanwhile, by analysing the concrete examples in the source language and target language on word level and sentence level, the paper points out that the differences are a reflection of translators identities, translation styles and aims.

#### 20. Gaming country rankings: Consultancies as knowledge brokers for global benchmarks
**Authors**: Broome
**Year**: 2021
**DOI**: 10.1111/padm.12809
**URL**: https://doi.org/10.1111/padm.12809

**Abstract**: AbstractThis article explores how for‐profit consultancies mediate knowledge about global benchmarks in developing countries. Drawing on the case of the Ease of Doing Business rankings, published annually by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation between 2005 and 2019, it examines the role consultancies play as knowledge brokers connecting global benchmarks produced by intergovernmental organizations to regulatory reform programs undertaken by national public administrations. The article shows how consultancies contracted to implement business enabling environment projects by the United States Agency for International Development advised national policymakers on how to design reforms to improve their country's ranking status. Lending weight to criticisms that shifts in country rankings are misleading as an indicator of changes in regulatory quality, the findings suggest that consultancies have leveraged benchmarks to perpetuate demand for their own expertise rather than to improve the evidence base for aid allocation and the evaluation of development projects.

**DOI**: 10.1177/2056305119880177
**URL**: https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305119880177

**Abstract**: The skirmish between game engines Unity and Unreal presents a new front in the platformization of cultural production. This article argues that such programs are “platform tools.” They enable amateurs and professionals to not only build content for platforms but also “lock-in” industry ideologies in the ideation, production, implementation, and distribution of digital creative work, resulting in a homogeneity of developers, practices, and products. The Unity engine’s history, features, and place in the game production pipeline makes it a paradigmatic “platform tool.” Findings from 90 interviews with VR enthusiasts show that Unity set the boundaries or “rules” for developers’ everyday activities and, despite enthusiasm about the medium’s potential, compelled them to create content which conformed to popular gaming genres and standards.

**DOI**: 10.47476/jat.v8i8.2025.355
**URL**: https://doi.org/10.47476/jat.v8i8.2025.355

**Abstract**: Since 2020, game accessibility has gained significant attention from both industry and academia. For players with visual disabilities, features such as screen readers, sound cues, contrast settings and, more recently, audio description (AD) have been a game changer. In fact, research on game AD is still in its early stages, and more studies are needed to explore user needs and preferences. This paper examines AD as a crucial accessibility feature in games, beginning with a review of its current implementation, which primarily focuses on non-interactive game content. It then outlines findings from the Researching Audio Description: Translation, Delivery and New Scenarios (RAD) Project, specifically focusing on insights gathered from fifteen interviews with blind and low-vision adults in Spain. The interviews cover three topics: lack of game accessibility, potential features for AD in games, and next steps for improving game accessibility. Key interview results highlight the potential of incorporating AD into game design to improve access to non-interactive content. The paper concludes with ten guidelines addressed at developers, researchers, and other stakeholders to enhance game accessibility, stressing the importance of integrating accessibility at all stages of development in collaboration with players with disabilities.
Lay summary
Game accessibility means removing barriers that stop people, especially those with disabilities, from being able to play video games. In the past few years, the game industry and academia have shown a growing interest in game accessibility. Many games now offer accessibility features, such as screen readers, sound cues, contrast settings, and audio description (AD). AD is particularly useful for players who are blind or have low vision because it verbally narrates what is happening on the screen. However, despite these advances, there is still much work to be done. Research on how best to use AD in video games is still in its early stages, and more studies are needed to understand what blind and low vision players really want and need from AD in games.In this paper, we focus on the potential of AD as a key accessibility feature in video games. We start by reviewing how AD has been used in games so far. Our findings reveal that, while AD has been introduced in a few games, it is mostly limited to non-interactive content, like cutscenes. Then, we look at research projects about AD in video games, focusing on the RAD Project, in which we participated. This project gathered feedback from people with visual disabilities to learn about their experiences with AD and accessibility in video games.As part of this project, we interviewed 15 blind and low vision adults living in Spain. These interviews helped us understand their thoughts about game accessibility, with a focus on AD. Participants emphasized that AD should be built into the game from the start, not added later. They also felt that AD could greatly improve their gaming experience, especially by helping them understand game content that is not interactive.Based on these interviews and our review of current research, we created ten guidelines for developers, researchers, and other stakeholders involved in game accessibility. These guidelines encourage the inclusion of accessibility features throughout the entire game development process. They also stress how important it is to include people with disabilities when designing and testing games so that accessibility features work as intended. By following these guidelines, games can become more inclusive and enjoyable for everyone.

**Authors**: Ribeiro, Carvalho, Rodrigues
**Year**: 2025
**DOI**: 10.1109/TG.2024.3487054
**URL**: https://doi.org/10.1109/TG.2024.3487054

**Abstract**: Creating content for digital video game is an expensive segment of the development process, and many techniques have been explored to automate it. Much of the generated content is graphical, ranging from textures and sprites to typographical elements and user interfaces. Numerous techniques have been explored to automate the generation of these assets, with recent advancements incorporating artificial intelligence methodologies, such as deep learning generative models. This study comprehensively surveys the literature from 2016 onward, focusing on using machine learning to generate image-based assets for video game development, reviewing the deep learning approaches employed, and analyzing the specific challenges found. Specifically, the deep learning approaches employed, the problems addressed within the domain, and the metrics used for evaluating the results. The study demonstrates a knowledge gap in generative methods for some types of video game assets. In addition, applicability and effectiveness of the most used evaluation metrics in the literature are studied. As future research prospects, with the increase in popularity of generative AI, the adoption of such techniques will be seen in automation processes.

#### 6. Inherent Addiction Mechanisms in Video Games' Gacha
**Authors**: Thavamuni, Khalid, Iida
**Year**: 2025
**DOI**: 10.3390/info16100890
**URL**: https://doi.org/10.3390/info16100890

**Abstract**: Gacha games, particularly those using Free-to-Play (F2P) models, have become increasingly popular yet controversial due to their addictive mechanics, often likened to gambling. This study investigates the inherent addictive mechanisms of Gacha games, focusing on Genshin Impact, a leading title in the genre. We analyze the interplay between reward frequency, game attractiveness, and player addiction using the Game Refinement theory and the Motion in Mind framework. Our analysis identifies a critical threshold at approximately 55 pulls per rare item (N≈55), with a corresponding gravity-in-mind value of 7.4. Beyond this point, the system exhibits gambling-like dynamics, as indicated by Game Refinement and Motion in Mind metrics. This threshold was measured using empirical gacha data collected from Genshin Impact players and analyzed through theoretical models. While not claiming direct causal evidence of player behavior change, the results highlight a measurable boundary where structural design risks fostering addiction-like compulsion. The study contributes theoretical insights with ethical implications for game design, by identifying critical thresholds in reward frequency and game dynamics that mark the shift toward gambling-like reinforcement. The methodologies, including quantitative analysis and empirical data, ensure robust results contributing to responsible digital entertainment discourse.

**Authors**: Aytaş
**Year**: 2025
**DOI**: 10.37999/udekad.1611713
**URL**: https://doi.org/10.37999/udekad.1611713

**Abstract**: This study investigates the impact of integrating visual and auditory modalities into neural machine translation (NMT) processes. Traditional text-based NMT models face limitations in translation quality due to their inability to capture contextual and cultural nuances effectively. This research demonstrates that incorporating visual and auditory elements—such as scene context, character expressions, intonation, and emphasis—leads to significant improvements in translation quality. The study highlights the capacity of multimodal models to preserve cultural and emotional contexts beyond linguistic fidelity. It explores the potential of these models in various applications, including subtitle translation, video game localization, and educational materials. The findings show that visual and auditory modalities enhance the interaction with linguistic context, producing context-aware and culturally aligned content in translation processes. Additionally, this work systematically compares deep learning models such as Transformer, BERT, and GPT, evaluating their characteristics in improving translation quality. The results indicate that new technologies integrating visual and auditory contexts offer significant advantages over traditional text-based models. This has important implications for both theoretical discussions and practical applications.

**DOI**: 10.26034/cm.jostrans.2022.090
**URL**: https://doi.org/10.26034/cm.jostrans.2022.090

**Abstract**: As part of an international medical project, therapeutic video games were co-translated into thirteen languages for children with asthma in collaboration with pneumopediatricians, pharmacists, medical interns, translators, and IT specialists. Translation of these games differs from that of commercial games: longer deadlines, direct translation without the English pivot, possibility of viewing the game (translation in context) and editing the source text. The present study discusses the translation strategies related to health issues for young recipients. The findings show that regular exchanges among collaborators helped the translators to choose between translation, localisation, globalisation ("reversed localisation"), or even "re-creation" appropriately. In addition to medical knowledge, the translators must acquire the registers specific to the players' world and the language codes of the target audience. They must utilise creativity and humor to maintain emotions for game players while integrating technical data specific to each country.

**DOI**: 10.61132/sintaksis.v2i6.1193
**URL**: https://doi.org/10.61132/sintaksis.v2i6.1193

**Abstract**: This study examines the interpretation of verbal and visual signs in the cutscenes of the video game Elden Ring. Semiotics, the study of signs and their meanings, provides the framework for analyzing these cinematic elements. Video games often embed narrative clues within visual and verbal signs, but players frequently overlook them, particularly during cutscenes, which interrupts gameplay to deliver critical story content. This research focuses on the main boss cutscenes in Elden Ring, which integrate environmental storytelling and visual signs to convey the lore of The Lands Between. Utilizing Peirce’s theory of signs and Barthes’ theory of meaning, the study identifies and classifies visual signs—icons, indices, and symbols—within the cutscenes to interpret their narrative significance. The data is derived from eight main boss cutscenes recorded during gameplay and supplemented by external visual references. A qualitative approach was employed, encompassing data collection through documentation, detailed visual analysis, and descriptive presentation of findings. Results indicate that Elden Ring’s cutscenes are rich with embedded signs that enhance the storytelling experience, though their nuanced meanings often require active interpretation and community discussion. This research underscores the importance of cutscenes in contributing to the depth and immersion of the game’s narrative.

#### 14. Listen With Seeing: Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning for Audio-Visual Event Localization
**Authors**: Sun, Chen, Zhu, Zhang, Lu, Chen
**Year**: 2025
**DOI**: 10.1109/TMM.2025.3535359
**URL**: https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2025.3535359

**Abstract**: In real-world physiological and psychological scenarios, there often exists a robust complementary correlation between audio and visual signals. Audio-Visual Event Localization (AVEL) aims to identify segments with Audio-Visual Events (AVEs) that contain both audio and visual tracks in unconstrained videos. Prior studies have predominantly focused on audio-visual cross-modal fusion methods, overlooking the fine-grained exploration of the cross-modal information fusion mechanism. Moreover, due to the inherent heterogeneity of multi-modal data, inevitable new noise is introduced during the audio-visual fusion process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Cross-modal Contrastive Learning Network (CCLN) for AVEL, comprising a backbone network and a branch network. In the backbone network, drawing inspiration from physiological theories of sensory integration, we elucidate the process of audio-visual information fusion, interaction, and integration from an information-flow perspective. Notably, the Self-constrained Bi-modal Interaction (SBI) module is a bi-modal attention structure integrated with audio-visual fusion information, and through gated processing of the audio-visual correlation matrix, it effectively captures inter-modal correlation. The Foreground Event Enhancement (FEE) module emphasizes the significance of event-level boundaries by elongating the distance between scene events during training through adaptive weights. Furthermore, we introduce weak video-level labels to constrain the cross-modal semantic alignment of audio-visual events and design a weakly supervised cross-modal contrastive learning loss (WCCL Loss) function, which enhances the quality of fusion representation in the dual-branch contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments conducted on the AVE dataset for both fully supervised and weakly supervised event localization, as well as Cross-Modal Localization (CML) tasks, demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

**DOI**: 10.26034/cm.jostrans.2018.216
**URL**: https://doi.org/10.26034/cm.jostrans.2018.216

**Abstract**: With the era of globalisation, China has become one of the most important video game markets in the world. To enter the Chinese market, culture adjustments are often made to video games in order to meet the needs and expectations of Chinese gamers. After briefly describing the characteristics of the Chinese game market, this article will focus on the process of cultural adaptation that games undergo when they are localised into Chinese, focusing on game-related aspects such as number format, food-related terminology, myths and legends, songs, the use of colours, character design, and game mechanics, as well as sociocultural, economic and political issues such as gaming habits and censorship. A number of examples are provided to illustrate how the above-mentioned aspects may affect the success of a foreign game in the Chinese market. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of cultural adaptation in game localisation into Chinese and outlining future research avenues.

AR and VR are innovations that have experienced a massive advancement and are prevalent across the entertainment industry and the learning process, healthcare, industries, and more. The study defines the basic concepts and the physical components that form the basis of AR and VR. It then goes over specific examples, using AR in the context of interactive education and its social impact as well as in operations such as surgeries and in factory maintenance while demonstrating the applications of VR in gaming, education and as a therapy tool. A fundamental question of the examined technologies, which is primarily discussed in the paper, includes the distinct challenges it encountered the hardware constraints of the solutions, the problems related to UX and UI, and the privacy-related concerns. Moreover, it covers the morality and social impact of the integration of AR and VR into society. Finally, examining the future directions of the survey, it is revealed that possible technologies and research areas for the next generation of AR and VR applications are discussed. Consequently, this overview seeks to present useful recommendations regarding the current status of four AR and VR technologies and their possible future developments.

#### 17. What is My Value? Digital Questions in Aesthetic Education: the Case of Video Game
**Authors**: Aimo
**Year**: 2024
**DOI**: 10.54103/2039-9251/27834
**URL**: https://doi.org/10.54103/2039-9251/27834

**Abstract**: New generations are born and raised within a digital ecosystem that is becoming increasingly pervasive and sophisticated for profit. Examining the reasons and effects of this early and prolonged exposure to mediation and seduction processes operated by electronic devices is fundamental not only from pedagogical and philosophical perspectives, but also from ethical and political ones. At stake is the very possibility of aisthesis: that intimate and free encounter, with self and other, which is as cognitively as it is emotionally connoted, but above all embodied. The article addresses this issue by examining the case of the video game, an object within one of the most flourishing markets, that absorbs a large part of the everyday life of children and teenagers. By interweaving different disciplinary perspectives, the aim is to reflect on the perception of value that massive consumption of this simulation may entail. The thesis proposed here is twofold: on the one hand, the fiction of the video game tends to present itself as true, on the other, it shapes the perception on the predominant capitalist model, i.e. that of productivity, addiction, competition, and acceleration. Only an aesthetic education that allows children and young people to experience this complexity while simultaneously enabling them to grasp the breadth and power of their own potential is able to preserve the possibility of a free and conscious learning and development.

#### 18. The video game industry’s money laundering problem: when do game publishers become money transmitters?
**Authors**: Roomberg
**Year**: 2023
**DOI**: 10.21202/2782-2923.2023.3.630-644
**URL**: https://doi.org/10.21202/2782-2923.2023.3.630-644

**Abstract**: Objective: to study the problem of money laundering in video game industry and to develop measures to minimize this illegal behavior.Methods: dialectical approach to cognition of social phenomena, allowing to analyze them in historical development and functioning in the context of the totality of objective and subjective factors, which predetermined the following research methods: formal-logical and sociological.Results: as enthusiasm for immersive multiplayer video games continues to grow, players are placing a high degree of value on virtual items like in-game currency, weapons, vehicles, and “skins”. The value of these items, paired with features that allow players to buy and sell them, has opened the door to criminals who can exploit these features to launder money. The United States maintains a robust legal framework to prevent and punish money laundering. One key piece of that framework is imposing certain reporting and recordkeeping duties on “financial institutions”, including money transmitters. If a company is subject to these duties, it must abide by complex and expensive anti-money laundering compliance requirements.Scientific novelty: the article, for the first time, considers the issue whether a game publisher is a criminal money transmitter. The paper takes up that question detailing the specific game features and publisher policies that, under current rules and guidance, lead to or rebuff the conclusion that a game publisher is a money transmitter.Practical significance: the main provisions and conclusions of the article can be used in scientific, pedagogical and law enforcement activities when considering the issues related to the qualification of actions of video games publishers in case of their participation in money laundering.The article was first published in English language by Fordham Law Review Online.

**URL**: https://doi.org/10.56397/jlcs.2025.04.07

**Abstract**: With China’s increasing cultural influence in the global market, video game localization has become essential in ensuring accessibility and cultural authenticity. As China’s first AAA single-player game, Black Myth: Wukong presents unique localization challenges due to its rich cultural and narrative elements. This study applies Communicative Translation Theory (CTT) to analyze its English localization, focusing on translating character names, in-game achievements, and dialogues. Using qualitative textual analysis, the research evaluates strategies such as adaptation, simplification, and idiomatic rendering. Findings reveal both effective localization techniques and areas to be improved, offering insights for refining Chinese video game localization strategies.

**Authors**: Rehberg, Williams, Batmaz, Ortega

**DOI**: 10.1145/3746059.3747682
**URL**: https://doi.org/10.1145/3746059.3747682

**Abstract**: Six-degree-of-freedom audio is a growing interest in interactive software, but it does not easily conform to object-based rendering when achieved with arrays of ambisonics microphones. Prior studies rely on subjective metrics also, which do not clearly indicate how this additional audio interaction might aid a human in a localization task – an indication of enhanced spatial awareness of a sound event. In this paper, we propose an alternative recording and playback technique to achieve six-degree-of-freedom audio to minimize recording overhead, yield object-based rendering, and verify enhanced spatialization through objective testing. The approach taken in this paper utilizes existing audio playback tools in the Unity game engine, and can be redeployed quickly to allow researchers outside of audio engineering exploration in six-degree-of-freedom audio applications. Two studies were conducted within a group of participants using a Microsoft Hololens 2 – testing for interpretation of directional sound cues in a stationary position, and testing the proposed technique in a mobile task. Participants were able to discern additional information within the front-facing “blind spots” and were effectively perfect in a localization task with the proposed audio technique. Participants did not achieve the same performance level with a head-related transfer function alone – indicating meaningful cueing with six-degree-of-freedom sound.
