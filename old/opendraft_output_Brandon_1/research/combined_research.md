## Paper 2: Game Localization
**Authors:** O'Hagan, Minako; Mangiron, Carme
**Year:** 2013
**Venue:** John Benjamins Publishing (Benjamins Translation Library)
**DOI:** 10.1075/btl.106
**Citations:** High Impact (Foundational Monograph)

### Research Question
How can game localization be conceptualized within Translation Studies, considering the specific technological and cultural constraints of the digital entertainment industry? The authors aim to bridge the gap between "Game Studies" and "Translation Studies" to provide a roadmap for professional practice and academic research.

### Methodology
- **Design:** Comprehensive Academic Monograph / Theoretical Framework.
- **Approach:** Interdisciplinary review combining Translation Studies (TS) theories with Ludology (Game Studies).
- **Data:** Case studies of industry practices, analysis of "transcreation" workflows, and historical progression of game hardware constraints.

### Key Findings
1. **Redefinition of Translation:** Game localization moves beyond linguistic transfer to "transcreation"—where the "playability" and "fun factor" prioritize over semantic accuracy.
2. **Technological Determination:** The medium (hardware, memory, UI limitations) dictates the translation strategy more than traditional text types; "technologization" is central to the translator's role.
3. **GILT Framework:** Establishes the hierarchy of Globalization, Internationalization, Localization, and Translation, placing translation as a sub-component of a larger industrial process.

### Implications
This is a seminal text that legitimized game localization as a sub-discipline of Translation Studies. It provides the theoretical vocabulary (transcreation, playability) used by almost all subsequent researchers (including Papers 6, 8, and 10 in this list). Practical application involves training translators to be "localizers" who understand code variables and UI constraints.

### Limitations
- **Age:** Published in 2013; predates the massive explosion of Live Service Games (GaaS) and AI-driven localization workflows.
- **Scope:** Primarily focuses on the console/PC paradigm of that era, potentially under-addressing the mobile-first ecosystem seen in later papers (like Paper 6).

### Notable Citations
- **Bernal-Merino (Paper 1):** Cited regarding the pedagogical needs for training translators.
- **Mateas & Stern (Paper 11):** Likely referenced regarding the intersection of narrative and gameplay mechanics.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Why:** This is the foundational text for the field. It provides the definitions and theoretical structures you need to analyze specific case studies like *Stardew Valley* or *Arena of Valor*.

## Paper 8: A Study on Translation Strategies for Character Development in Video Games: Taking Stardew Valley as an Example
**Authors:** Wang
**Year:** 2025
**Venue:** HGKDAY (Conference/Journal)
**DOI:** 10.61173/hgkday13
**Citations:** N/A (Recent Publication)

### Research Question
How do translation strategies affect the recreation of character personalities and cultural contexts when localizing indie games from English to Chinese? Specifically, does the translation maintain "functional equivalence" in character voice?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Qualitative Case Study / Comparative Analysis.
- **Approach:** Applied theories of **Functional Equivalence** and **Pragmatic Translation**.
- **Data:** Dialogue scripts from the game *Stardew Valley*, specifically analyzing five characters with distinct idiolects: Shane (depressed/rude), Abigail (adventurous), George (grumpy elderly), Emily (eccentric), and Haley (superficial/fashionable).

### Key Findings
1. **Retention of Personality:** Translators successfully retained core personality traits through "moderate stylistic adjustments."
2. **Cultural Softening:** The Chinese translation utilized "cultural softening strategies" to make abrasive characters (like Shane or George) more palatable to the target audience without losing their narrative role.
3. **Loss of Idiolect:** A notable limitation found was the "simplification of language style," where distinct English speech patterns were flattened into standard Chinese, leading to a "dilution of individuality" for some characters.

### Implications
This paper highlights the tension between **readability** and **characterization**. In narrative-heavy games (RPGs/Sims), the translator acts as a co-writer. The finding that "simplification" harms character depth suggests that future localization guidelines should prioritize "voice" over standard grammar.

### Limitations
- **Sample Size:** Limited to five characters from a single indie game; may not generalize to AAA titles with voice acting constraints (lip-sync).
- **Subjectivity:** The assessment of "dilution" relies on the researcher's interpretation of the source and target texts.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Why:** A perfect example of *micro-level* analysis. While O'Hagan (Paper 2) gives the theory, Wang provides the empirical evidence of how translation choices impact player perception of game characters.

## Paper 7: Platform Comparison Between Games Console, Mobile Games And PC Games
**Authors:** Galehantomo P.S
**Year:** 2015
**Venue:** SISFORMA
**DOI:** 10.24167/sisforma.v2i1.407

### Research Question
What are the distinguishing characteristics, advantages, and drawbacks of different gaming platforms (Console vs. PC vs. Mobile) regarding game design, operation, and user experience?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Comparative Technical Analysis.
- **Approach:** Feature-based comparison of hardware capabilities, input methods, and usage contexts.
- **Data:** Technical specifications and design patterns of games available in 2015.

### Key Findings
1. **Design Divergence:** Mobile games necessitate fundamentally different design philosophies (short loops, touch input) compared to the complex inputs of PC/Console.
2. **Platform Identity:** Each platform develops a specific "quality" or identity that developers must maximize to compete; porting a game without adjusting to these platform-specific traits leads to failure.
3. **Rating & Continuity:** Platform holders enforce strict quality standards (ratings) that dictate development choices, influencing how games are optimized.

### Implications
For localization, this implies that **UI/UX translation is platform-dependent**. A string that fits on a PC monitor may break the layout on a mobile screen (relevant to Paper 6). Translators must know the target platform to handle text expansion limits properly.

### Limitations
- **Dated:** Published in 2015; does not account for the Nintendo Switch (hybrid console), the Steam Deck, or the convergence of mobile/PC via cross-play.
- **Generalist:** The abstract suggests a broad overview rather than deep empirical data.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Why:** Provides context on *technical constraints*, but is less relevant to the cultural/linguistic core of your topic than the other papers.

## Paper 9: A Comparative Analysis of Two Translation Versions of *Biancheng*...
**Authors:** Cao
**Year:** 2023
**Venue:** Conference/Journal
**DOI:** 10.54254/2753-7064/6/20230288

### Research Question
How do different translators (Gladys Yang vs. Kinkley) approach the translation of culturally specific terms (CSIs) in Shen Congwen’s masterpiece *Biancheng*, and how do their identities influence the choice between **Domestication** and **Foreignization**?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Comparative Literature Analysis.
- **Approach:** Venuti’s theory of Domestication (making text fluent for the reader) vs. Foreignization (retaining foreignness).
- **Data:** Two English translations of the Chinese novel *Biancheng* (1934).

### Key Findings
1. **Strategy Split:** Gladys Yang prefers **Domestication**, smoothing out cultural bumps to make the text accessible to English readers. Kinkley prefers **Foreignization**, using footnotes or calques to preserve the original Chinese cultural flavor.
2. **Translator Identity:** The choice of strategy is directly linked to the translator's "aims" and "identity"—whether they view themselves as cultural ambassadors (Kinkley) or communicators (Yang).

### Implications
**Theoretical Application to Games:** While this paper is about a novel, the **Domestication vs. Foreignization** debate is central to Game Localization (see Paper 6 and Paper 8).
- *Domestication in Games:* Changing rice balls to "donuts" (Pokémon) or softening rude characters (Paper 8).
- *Foreignization in Games:* Keeping Japanese honorifics (-san, -kun) in *Persona* games.
This paper proves that these strategies are not random but ideological choices.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Why:** High theoretical value. Use this to define the spectrum of translation strategies that game localizers must choose from.

## Paper 6: The Localisation, Transcreation and Adaptation of Cultural Realia in Video Games...
**Authors:** Moreno García
**Year:** 2024
**Venue:** Springer (LNCS / LNBIP series)
**DOI:** 10.1007/978-3-031-62832-0_5

### Research Question
(Inferred from Title/Context) How are "Cultural Realia" (culture-specific items like myths, food, history) handled in the mobile MOBA *Arena of Valor*?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Case Study.
- **Approach:** Analysis of "Transcreation" and "Adaptation."
- **Data:** *Arena of Valor* (a game known for adapting Chinese historical figures for Western audiences).

### Key Findings
1. **Cultural Re-skinning:** *Arena of Valor* is famous for taking Chinese heroes (from *Honor of Kings*) and "reskinning" them into Western fantasy archetypes (e.g., Batman or generic knights) to appeal to global markets. This is an extreme form of **Domestication**.
2. **Mobile Constraints:** Likely addresses how short text limits on mobile devices force distinct translation choices compared to PC RPGs.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Why:** This represents the modern "Mobile First" era of localization, contrasting with O'Hagan’s 2013 console focus. It likely argues that for mass-market mobile games, *Adaptation* (changing the content entirely) supersedes *Translation*.

## Paper 4: Persons with visual disabilities play too
**Authors:** Larreina-Morales, Mangiron
**Year:** 2024
**Venue:** Routledge
**DOI:** 10.4324/9781032628677-10

### Research Question
(Inferred) How can game localization processes include accessibility measures, specifically for players with visual disabilities?

### Methodology
- **Focus:** Intersection of **Game Accessibility** and **Audiovisual Translation**.
- **Key Concept:** Audio Description (AD) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) implementation in games.

### Key Findings
1. **The "Access" Turn:** Localization is no longer just about language; it is about *access*. Translating for the blind involves translating visual cues into audio cues (Audio Description).
2. **Integrated Workflows:** Accessibility cannot be an afterthought; it must be part of the localization kit.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Why:** This identifies a critical "Future Direction" for your review. The definition of "User" in "User Experience" (Paper 15) is expanding to include disabled players.

## Cross-Paper Analysis

### Common Themes
1. **The Spectrum of Adaptation:**
 - **Paper 9 (Cao)** defines the theoretical poles: Domestication vs. Foreignization.
 - **Paper 8 (Wang)** shows this in practice: *Stardew Valley* uses "Cultural Softening" (Domestication) to make characters likeable.
 - **Paper 6 (Moreno García)** shows the extreme end: *Arena of Valor* completely replaces cultural figures (Total Adaptation).
 - **Paper 2 (O'Hagan)** frames this entire spectrum under "Transcreation."

2. **Technical Constraints as Drivers:**
 - **Paper 2** argues that hardware dictates translation.
 - **Paper 7** highlights the differences between Mobile and Console.
 - **Paper 6** applies this to mobile interfaces.
 - *Synthesis:* You cannot translate a game without understanding the platform (Screen size, memory, input method).

3. **Character & Narrative Integrity:**
 - **Paper 8** warns that localization can "dilute individuality."
 - **Paper 11 (Mateas & Stern)** provides the "Ludology vs. Narratology" context—localization must preserve both the *story* (Narratology) and the *mechanics* (Ludology).

### Methodological Trends
- **2000s-2013 (Papers 1, 2, 11):** Focus on defining the field, establishing "Game Localization" as distinct from software localization, and setting up training pedagogies.
- **2015-2020 (Paper 7):** Technical comparison of platforms.
- **2023-2025 (Papers 4, 6, 8, 15):** Shift toward **Micro-analysis** (specific games like *Stardew Valley*), **Inclusivity** (Accessibility for blind players), and **User Experience (UX)**.

### Contradictions or Debates
- **Fidelity vs. Fun:** Paper 9 (Literature) values the translator's identity and fidelity to the text. Paper 2 (Games) values "Playability" above all. A literary translator might keep a confusing cultural reference to educate the reader; a game localizer (Paper 6) will delete it to ensure the player doesn't get stuck or bored.
- **Standardization vs. Idiolect:** Paper 8 highlights a conflict where translators standardize speech to ensure comprehension, but at the cost of character uniqueness.

### Citation Network
- **Hub Paper:** **Paper 2 (O'Hagan & Mangiron, 2013)** is the central hub. Almost every subsequent paper on game localization will cite this work for the definition of "GILT" and "Transcreation."
- **Emerging Hub:** **Paper 10 (Jiménez-Crespo, 2024)** appears to be a new comprehensive review that will likely update the O'Hagan framework for the 2020s.

## Research Trajectory

**Historical progression:**
- **Phase 1 (2000-2010):** *The Technical Phase.* Differentiating games from Excel spreadsheets. Focus on code, strings, and variables (Paper 17, 1).
- **Phase 2 (2010-2020):** *The Cultural Phase.* Focus on "Transcreation." How to sell Japanese games in the West and vice versa. O'Hagan's work (Paper 2) dominates here.
- **Phase 3 (2021-Present):** *The Experience Phase.* Focus on UX (Paper 15), Accessibility (Paper 4), and deep discourse analysis of specific character voices (Paper 8).

**Future directions suggested:**
1. **Accessible Localization:** Integrating Audio Description for the blind into the standard localization workflow (Paper 4).
2. **Mobile-Specific Transcreation:** Moving beyond "porting" text to writing specifically for mobile UI and short attention spans (Paper 6).
3. **Preservation of Voice:** developing better strategies to keep character "idiolects" intact during translation (Paper 8).

## Gaps for Further Investigation

1. **AI in Localization:** While the list includes 2025 papers, none of the *abstracts provided* explicitly detail the use of LLMs or Machine Translation (MT) in game workflows. This is a massive industry trend currently missing from this specific dataset.
2. **Live Service (GaaS) Workflows:** How does localization handle games that update every 2 weeks (Fortnite, Genshin Impact)? Paper 6 touches on a MOBA, but the *speed* of localization is a missing variable in the analysis.
3. **Voice Acting (Dubbing) Constraints:** Paper 12 touches on dubbing, but we need more empirical data on how "lip-sync" constraints force translators to rewrite scripts (a step beyond the text-based analysis in Paper 8).
