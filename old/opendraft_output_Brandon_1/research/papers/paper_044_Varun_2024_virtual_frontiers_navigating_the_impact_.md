## Abstract

This research study aims to investigate the two rapidly growing fields of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality from their technical aspect, possible uses, issues, and evolution. AR and VR are innovations that have experienced a massive advancement and are prevalent across the entertainment industry and the learning process, healthcare, industries, and more. The study defines the basic concepts and the physical components that form the basis of AR and VR. It then goes over specific examples, using AR in the context of interactive education and its social impact as well as in operations such as surgeries and in factory maintenance while demonstrating the applications of VR in gaming, education and as a therapy tool. A fundamental question of the examined technologies, which is primarily discussed in the paper, includes the distinct challenges it encountered the hardware constraints of the solutions, the problems related to UX and UI, and the privacy-related concerns. Moreover, it covers the morality and social impact of the integration of AR and VR into society. Finally, examining the future directions of the survey, it is revealed that possible technologies and research areas for the next generation of AR and VR applications are discussed. Consequently, this overview seeks to present useful recommendations regarding the current status of four AR and VR technologies and their possible future developments.
