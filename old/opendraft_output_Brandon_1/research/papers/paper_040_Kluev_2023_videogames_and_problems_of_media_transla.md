## Abstract

The article studies the possibility of translating a video game into other types of media, as well as the possibility of a reverse process. Research results received within the framework of the narratological theory of video games and the ludological theory of video games are used as methodological ground. The authors rely on the concept of translation presented in the works of B. Latour. The main provisions and conclusions are formulated by comparing ludological and narratological approaches to the problem of transferring a video game to other media types (cinema), as well as the reverse process. Basic concepts are identified, key points of methodological interest are set out. The article provides illustrative examples of video game translation into cinema, as well as examples of reverse translation, that are commented and explained in the context of the given methodologies. The conclusion is made about the prospects for investigating the issue in the context of media research and media practice.
