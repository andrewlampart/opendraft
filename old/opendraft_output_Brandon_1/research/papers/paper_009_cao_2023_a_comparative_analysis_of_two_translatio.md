### Research Question
How do different translators (Gladys Yang vs. Kinkley) approach the translation of culturally specific terms (CSIs) in Shen Congwen’s masterpiece *Biancheng*, and how do their identities influence the choice between **Domestication** and **Foreignization**?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Comparative Literature Analysis.
- **Approach:** Venuti’s theory of Domestication (making text fluent for the reader) vs. Foreignization (retaining foreignness).
- **Data:** Two English translations of the Chinese novel *Biancheng* (1934).

### Key Findings
1. **Strategy Split:** Gladys Yang prefers **Domestication**, smoothing out cultural bumps to make the text accessible to English readers. Kinkley prefers **Foreignization**, using footnotes or calques to preserve the original Chinese cultural flavor.
2. **Translator Identity:** The choice of strategy is directly linked to the translator's "aims" and "identity"—whether they view themselves as cultural ambassadors (Kinkley) or communicators (Yang).

### Implications
**Theoretical Application to Games:** While this paper is about a novel, the **Domestication vs. Foreignization** debate is central to Game Localization (see Paper 6 and Paper 8).
- *Domestication in Games:* Changing rice balls to "donuts" (Pokémon) or softening rude characters (Paper 8).
- *Foreignization in Games:* Keeping Japanese honorifics (-san, -kun) in *Persona* games.
This paper proves that these strategies are not random but ideological choices.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)
**Why:** High theoretical value. Use this to define the spectrum of translation strategies that game localizers must choose from.
