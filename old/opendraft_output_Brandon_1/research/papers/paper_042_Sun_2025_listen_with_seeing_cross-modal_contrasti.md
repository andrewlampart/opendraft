## Abstract

In real-world physiological and psychological scenarios, there often exists a robust complementary correlation between audio and visual signals. Audio-Visual Event Localization (AVEL) aims to identify segments with Audio-Visual Events (AVEs) that contain both audio and visual tracks in unconstrained videos. Prior studies have predominantly focused on audio-visual cross-modal fusion methods, overlooking the fine-grained exploration of the cross-modal information fusion mechanism. Moreover, due to the inherent heterogeneity of multi-modal data, inevitable new noise is introduced during the audio-visual fusion process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Cross-modal Contrastive Learning Network (CCLN) for AVEL, comprising a backbone network and a branch network. In the backbone network, drawing inspiration from physiological theories of sensory integration, we elucidate the process of audio-visual information fusion, interaction, and integration from an information-flow perspective. Notably, the Self-constrained Bi-modal Interaction (SBI) module is a bi-modal attention structure integrated with audio-visual fusion information, and through gated processing of the audio-visual correlation matrix, it effectively captures inter-modal correlation. The Foreground Event Enhancement (FEE) module emphasizes the significance of event-level boundaries by elongating the distance between scene events during training through adaptive weights. Furthermore, we introduce weak video-level labels to constrain the cross-modal semantic alignment of audio-visual events and design a weakly supervised cross-modal contrastive learning loss (WCCL Loss) function, which enhances the quality of fusion representation in the dual-branch contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments conducted on the AVE dataset for both fully supervised and weakly supervised event localization, as well as Cross-Modal Localization (CML) tasks, demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
