## Abstract

Biancheng, translated as Green Jade, Border Town, The Border Town, The Frontier City, is a masterpiece of Chinese contemporary writer Shen Congwen that has enjoyed a worldwide reputation since its publication in 1934. Among the translations of the masterpiece, the versions of Gladys Yangs and Kinkleys are more praised and influential. Hence, by making a comparative analysis of Gladys Yangs and Kinkleys versions from the perspective of domestication and foreignization, this article aims to discuss how the two versions differ in translation strategies and translation methods. Through the analysis, it is found that Yang tends to apply the domestication strategy while Kinkley prefers to adopt the foreignization strategy. Meanwhile, by analysing the concrete examples in the source language and target language on word level and sentence level, the paper points out that the differences are a reflection of translators identities, translation styles and aims.
