### Research Question
How do translation strategies affect the recreation of character personalities and cultural contexts when localizing indie games from English to Chinese? Specifically, does the translation maintain "functional equivalence" in character voice?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Qualitative Case Study / Comparative Analysis.
- **Approach:** Applied theories of **Functional Equivalence** and **Pragmatic Translation**.
- **Data:** Dialogue scripts from the game *Stardew Valley*, specifically analyzing five characters with distinct idiolects: Shane (depressed/rude), Abigail (adventurous), George (grumpy elderly), Emily (eccentric), and Haley (superficial/fashionable).

### Key Findings
1. **Retention of Personality:** Translators successfully retained core personality traits through "moderate stylistic adjustments."
2. **Cultural Softening:** The Chinese translation utilized "cultural softening strategies" to make abrasive characters (like Shane or George) more palatable to the target audience without losing their narrative role.
3. **Loss of Idiolect:** A notable limitation found was the "simplification of language style," where distinct English speech patterns were flattened into standard Chinese, leading to a "dilution of individuality" for some characters.

### Implications
This paper highlights the tension between **readability** and **characterization**. In narrative-heavy games (RPGs/Sims), the translator acts as a co-writer. The finding that "simplification" harms character depth suggests that future localization guidelines should prioritize "voice" over standard grammar.

### Limitations
- **Sample Size:** Limited to five characters from a single indie game; may not generalize to AAA titles with voice acting constraints (lip-sync).
- **Subjectivity:** The assessment of "dilution" relies on the researcher's interpretation of the source and target texts.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Why:** A perfect example of *micro-level* analysis. While O'Hagan (Paper 2) gives the theory, Wang provides the empirical evidence of how translation choices impact player perception of game characters.
