## Paper 4: Persons with visual disabilities play too
**Authors:** Larreina-Morales, Mangiron
**Year:** 2024
**Venue:** Routledge
**DOI:** 10.4324/9781032628677-10

### Research Question
(Inferred) How can game localization processes include accessibility measures, specifically for players with visual disabilities?

### Methodology
- **Focus:** Intersection of **Game Accessibility** and **Audiovisual Translation**.
- **Key Concept:** Audio Description (AD) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) implementation in games.

### Key Findings
1. **The "Access" Turn:** Localization is no longer just about language; it is about *access*. Translating for the blind involves translating visual cues into audio cues (Audio Description).
2. **Integrated Workflows:** Accessibility cannot be an afterthought; it must be part of the localization kit.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Why:** This identifies a critical "Future Direction" for your review. The definition of "User" in "User Experience" (Paper 15) is expanding to include disabled players.

## Cross-Paper Analysis

### Common Themes
1. **The Spectrum of Adaptation:**
 - **Paper 9 (Cao)** defines the theoretical poles: Domestication vs. Foreignization.
 - **Paper 8 (Wang)** shows this in practice: *Stardew Valley* uses "Cultural Softening" (Domestication) to make characters likeable.
 - **Paper 6 (Moreno García)** shows the extreme end: *Arena of Valor* completely replaces cultural figures (Total Adaptation).
 - **Paper 2 (O'Hagan)** frames this entire spectrum under "Transcreation."

2. **Technical Constraints as Drivers:**
 - **Paper 2** argues that hardware dictates translation.
 - **Paper 7** highlights the differences between Mobile and Console.
 - **Paper 6** applies this to mobile interfaces.
 - *Synthesis:* You cannot translate a game without understanding the platform (Screen size, memory, input method).

3. **Character & Narrative Integrity:**
 - **Paper 8** warns that localization can "dilute individuality."
 - **Paper 11 (Mateas & Stern)** provides the "Ludology vs. Narratology" context—localization must preserve both the *story* (Narratology) and the *mechanics* (Ludology).

### Methodological Trends
- **2000s-2013 (Papers 1, 2, 11):** Focus on defining the field, establishing "Game Localization" as distinct from software localization, and setting up training pedagogies.
- **2015-2020 (Paper 7):** Technical comparison of platforms.
- **2023-2025 (Papers 4, 6, 8, 15):** Shift toward **Micro-analysis** (specific games like *Stardew Valley*), **Inclusivity** (Accessibility for blind players), and **User Experience (UX)**.

### Contradictions or Debates
- **Fidelity vs. Fun:** Paper 9 (Literature) values the translator's identity and fidelity to the text. Paper 2 (Games) values "Playability" above all. A literary translator might keep a confusing cultural reference to educate the reader; a game localizer (Paper 6) will delete it to ensure the player doesn't get stuck or bored.
- **Standardization vs. Idiolect:** Paper 8 highlights a conflict where translators standardize speech to ensure comprehension, but at the cost of character uniqueness.

### Citation Network
- **Hub Paper:** **Paper 2 (O'Hagan & Mangiron, 2013)** is the central hub. Almost every subsequent paper on game localization will cite this work for the definition of "GILT" and "Transcreation."
- **Emerging Hub:** **Paper 10 (Jiménez-Crespo, 2024)** appears to be a new comprehensive review that will likely update the O'Hagan framework for the 2020s.

## Research Trajectory

**Historical progression:**
- **Phase 1 (2000-2010):** *The Technical Phase.* Differentiating games from Excel spreadsheets. Focus on code, strings, and variables (Paper 17, 1).
- **Phase 2 (2010-2020):** *The Cultural Phase.* Focus on "Transcreation." How to sell Japanese games in the West and vice versa. O'Hagan's work (Paper 2) dominates here.
- **Phase 3 (2021-Present):** *The Experience Phase.* Focus on UX (Paper 15), Accessibility (Paper 4), and deep discourse analysis of specific character voices (Paper 8).

**Future directions suggested:**
1. **Accessible Localization:** Integrating Audio Description for the blind into the standard localization workflow (Paper 4).
2. **Mobile-Specific Transcreation:** Moving beyond "porting" text to writing specifically for mobile UI and short attention spans (Paper 6).
3. **Preservation of Voice:** developing better strategies to keep character "idiolects" intact during translation (Paper 8).

3. **Paper 6: Cultural Realia in... Arena of Valor (Moreno García)** - *Best example* of modern, mobile-first cultural adaptation and the extreme "reskinning" practiced in global markets.
4. **Paper 4: Persons with visual disabilities play too (Larreina-Morales)** - *Novel.* Represents the cutting edge of inclusive game design/translation.
5. **Paper 11: Build It to Understand It (Mateas & Stern)** - *Foundational.* Necessary to understand the structure of games (Ludology) before trying to translate them.

## Gaps for Further Investigation

1. **AI in Localization:** While the list includes 2025 papers, none of the *abstracts provided* explicitly detail the use of LLMs or Machine Translation (MT) in game workflows. This is a massive industry trend currently missing from this specific dataset.
2. **Live Service (GaaS) Workflows:** How does localization handle games that update every 2 weeks (Fortnite, Genshin Impact)? Paper 6 touches on a MOBA, but the *speed* of localization is a missing variable in the analysis.
3. **Voice Acting (Dubbing) Constraints:** Paper 12 touches on dubbing, but we need more empirical data on how "lip-sync" constraints force translators to rewrite scripts (a step beyond the text-based analysis in Paper 8).
