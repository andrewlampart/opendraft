### Research Question
(Inferred from Title/Context) How are "Cultural Realia" (culture-specific items like myths, food, history) handled in the mobile MOBA *Arena of Valor*?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Case Study.
- **Approach:** Analysis of "Transcreation" and "Adaptation."
- **Data:** *Arena of Valor* (a game known for adapting Chinese historical figures for Western audiences).

### Key Findings
1. **Cultural Re-skinning:** *Arena of Valor* is famous for taking Chinese heroes (from *Honor of Kings*) and "reskinning" them into Western fantasy archetypes (e.g., Batman or generic knights) to appeal to global markets. This is an extreme form of **Domestication**.
2. **Mobile Constraints:** Likely addresses how short text limits on mobile devices force distinct translation choices compared to PC RPGs.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Why:** This represents the modern "Mobile First" era of localization, contrasting with O'Hagan’s 2013 console focus. It likely argues that for mass-market mobile games, *Adaptation* (changing the content entirely) supersedes *Translation*.
