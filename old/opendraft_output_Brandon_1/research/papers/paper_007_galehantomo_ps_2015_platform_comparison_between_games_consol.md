## Paper 7: Platform Comparison Between Games Console, Mobile Games And PC Games
**Authors:** Galehantomo P.S
**Year:** 2015
**Venue:** SISFORMA
**DOI:** 10.24167/sisforma.v2i1.407

### Research Question
What are the distinguishing characteristics, advantages, and drawbacks of different gaming platforms (Console vs. PC vs. Mobile) regarding game design, operation, and user experience?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Comparative Technical Analysis.
- **Approach:** Feature-based comparison of hardware capabilities, input methods, and usage contexts.
- **Data:** Technical specifications and design patterns of games available in 2015.

### Key Findings
1. **Design Divergence:** Mobile games necessitate fundamentally different design philosophies (short loops, touch input) compared to the complex inputs of PC/Console.
2. **Platform Identity:** Each platform develops a specific "quality" or identity that developers must maximize to compete; porting a game without adjusting to these platform-specific traits leads to failure.
3. **Rating & Continuity:** Platform holders enforce strict quality standards (ratings) that dictate development choices, influencing how games are optimized.

### Implications
For localization, this implies that **UI/UX translation is platform-dependent**. A string that fits on a PC monitor may break the layout on a mobile screen (relevant to Paper 6). Translators must know the target platform to handle text expansion limits properly.

### Limitations
- **Dated:** Published in 2015; does not account for the Nintendo Switch (hybrid console), the Steam Deck, or the convergence of mobile/PC via cross-play.
- **Generalist:** The abstract suggests a broad overview rather than deep empirical data.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐ (2/5)
**Why:** Provides context on *technical constraints*, but is less relevant to the cultural/linguistic core of your topic than the other papers.
