## Abstract

Gacha games, particularly those using Free-to-Play (F2P) models, have become increasingly popular yet controversial due to their addictive mechanics, often likened to gambling. This study investigates the inherent addictive mechanisms of Gacha games, focusing on Genshin Impact, a leading title in the genre. We analyze the interplay between reward frequency, game attractiveness, and player addiction using the Game Refinement theory and the Motion in Mind framework. Our analysis identifies a critical threshold at approximately 55 pulls per rare item (N≈55), with a corresponding gravity-in-mind value of 7.4. Beyond this point, the system exhibits gambling-like dynamics, as indicated by Game Refinement and Motion in Mind metrics. This threshold was measured using empirical gacha data collected from Genshin Impact players and analyzed through theoretical models. While not claiming direct causal evidence of player behavior change, the results highlight a measurable boundary where structural design risks fostering addiction-like compulsion. The study contributes theoretical insights with ethical implications for game design, by identifying critical thresholds in reward frequency and game dynamics that mark the shift toward gambling-like reinforcement. The methodologies, including quantitative analysis and empirical data, ensure robust results contributing to responsible digital entertainment discourse.
