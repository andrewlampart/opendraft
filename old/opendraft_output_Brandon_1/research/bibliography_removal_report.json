        "abstract": "Gacha games, particularly those using Free-to-Play (F2P) models, have become increasingly popular yet controversial due to their addictive mechanics, often likened to gambling. This study investigates the inherent addictive mechanisms of Gacha games, focusing on Genshin Impact, a leading title in the genre. We analyze the interplay between reward frequency, game attractiveness, and player addiction using the Game Refinement theory and the Motion in Mind framework. Our analysis identifies a critical threshold at approximately 55 pulls per rare item (N≈55), with a corresponding gravity-in-mind value of 7.4. Beyond this point, the system exhibits gambling-like dynamics, as indicated by Game Refinement and Motion in Mind metrics. This threshold was measured using empirical gacha data collected from Genshin Impact players and analyzed through theoretical models. While not claiming direct causal evidence of player behavior change, the results highlight a measurable boundary where structural design risks fostering addiction-like compulsion. The study contributes theoretical insights with ethical implications for game design, by identifying critical thresholds in reward frequency and game dynamics that mark the shift toward gambling-like reinforcement. The methodologies, including quantitative analysis and empirical data, ensure robust results contributing to responsible digital entertainment discourse.",

Research results received within the framework of the narratological theory of video games and the ludological theory of video games are used as methodological ground. The authors rely on the concept of translation presented in the works of B. Latour. The main provisions and conclusions are formulated by comparing ludological and narratological approaches to the problem of transferring a video game to other media types (cinema), as well as the reverse process. Basic concepts are identified, key points of methodological interest are set out. The article provides illustrative examples of video game translation into cinema, as well as examples of reverse translation, that are commented and explained in the context of the given methodologies. The conclusion is made about the prospects for investigating the issue in the context of media research and media practice.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis article explores how for‐profit consultancies mediate knowledge about global benchmarks in developing countries. Drawing on the case of the Ease of Doing Business rankings, published annually by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation between 2005 and 2019, it examines the role consultancies play as knowledge brokers connecting global benchmarks produced by intergovernmental organizations to regulatory reform programs undertaken by national public administrations. The article shows how consultancies contracted to implement business enabling environment projects by the United States Agency for International Development advised national policymakers on how to design reforms to improve their country's ranking status. Lending weight to criticisms that shifts in country rankings are misleading as an indicator of changes in regulatory quality, the findings suggest that consultancies have leveraged benchmarks to perpetuate demand for their own expertise rather than to improve the evidence base for aid allocation and the evaluation of development projects."

        "abstract": "The skirmish between game engines Unity and Unreal presents a new front in the platformization of cultural production. This article argues that such programs are “platform tools.” They enable amateurs and professionals to not only build content for platforms but also “lock-in” industry ideologies in the ideation, production, implementation, and distribution of digital creative work, resulting in a homogeneity of developers, practices, and products. The Unity engine’s history, features, and place in the game production pipeline makes it a paradigmatic “platform tool.” Findings from 90 interviews with VR enthusiasts show that Unity set the boundaries or “rules” for developers’ everyday activities and, despite enthusiasm about the medium’s potential, compelled them to create content which conformed to popular gaming genres and standards."

        "abstract": "Six-degree-of-freedom audio is a growing interest in interactive software, but it does not easily conform to object-based rendering when achieved with arrays of ambisonics microphones. Prior studies rely on subjective metrics also, which do not clearly indicate how this additional audio interaction might aid a human in a localization task – an indication of enhanced spatial awareness of a sound event. In this paper, we propose an alternative recording and playback technique to achieve six-degree-of-freedom audio to minimize recording overhead, yield object-based rendering, and verify enhanced spatialization through objective testing. The approach taken in this paper utilizes existing audio playback tools in the Unity game engine, and can be redeployed quickly to allow researchers outside of audio engineering exploration in six-degree-of-freedom audio applications. Two studies were conducted within a group of participants using a Microsoft Hololens 2 – testing for interpretation of directional sound cues in a stationary position, and testing the proposed technique in a mobile task. Participants were able to discern additional information within the front-facing “blind spots” and were effectively perfect in a localization task with the proposed audio technique. Participants did not achieve the same performance level with a head-related transfer function alone – indicating meaningful cueing with six-degree-of-freedom sound.",
