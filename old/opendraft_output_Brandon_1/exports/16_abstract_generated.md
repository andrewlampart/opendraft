**Research Problem and Approach:** The global video game industry has evolved into a dominant cultural force, necessitating sophisticated localization strategies to ensure linguistic and cultural accessibility for international audiences. However, a significant disconnect remains between theoretical translation frameworks and the practical, technical realities of the industry, particularly regarding the multimodal nature of modern gaming. This thesis investigates the complex interplay between linguistic translation, cultural adaptation, and technical engineering within the "GILT" framework (Globalization, Internationalization, Localization, and Translation) to address how developers preserve the gameplay gestalt across diverse cultural boundaries.

**Methodology and Findings:** By conducting a comparative analysis of selected video game genres and regional case studies, this research examines the industry's transition from a "box-product" model to a continuous service-oriented approach. The study evaluates the shift from textual translation to holistic "transcreation," analyzing how auditory cues, visual assets, and narrative elements are modified to maintain semiotic cohesion in high-growth markets like China and Turkey. The analysis reveals that successful localization relies heavily on early integration into the development pipeline to mitigate "blind" translation errors and navigate rigid technical constraints.

**Key Contributions:** This research makes three primary contributions: (1) A comprehensive historical delineation of localization practices from early hardware constraints to modern AI-assisted asset generation, (2) A critical assessment of how regulatory frameworks and censorship dictate narrative alterations and technical implementation in restrictive markets, and (3) An integrated perspective on the localizer as a key stakeholder, bridging the gap between solitary translation tasks and collaborative software engineering.

**Implications:** These findings have significant implications for both Translation Studies and the interactive entertainment industry, suggesting that localization must be treated as a fundamental design pillar rather than a post-production afterthought. The study provides a roadmap for navigating the economic imperatives of global expansion while preserving cultural authenticity and adhering to complex legal compliance standards in virtual economies.
