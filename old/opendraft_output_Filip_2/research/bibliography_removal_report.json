        "abstract": "Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 180,000 patients die from burns every year, which is considered a serious public health issue. Patients with burns require immediate pre-hospital care and transport to specialized treatment facilities. The aim of this study was to outline the profile of the burn patient from the perspective of the Polish Medical Air Rescue (PMAR), as well as to analyze the medical procedures being implemented. Methods: The study includes 2154 interventions by air emergency medical teams (AEMS) which provided aid for burn patients. The analysis covered the period from 2018 to 2022, including nationwide data made available from the IT systems of the PMAR. Statistical design was used, allowing for correlations of variables, at a significance level of p < 0.05. Results: Patients’ ages ranged from 1 month to 96 years (mean 35.05; SD ± 26.88). Adult patients (n = 1409; 65.41%) constituted the vast majority. The number of interventions to children below 1-year-old was noticeable (n = 394; 18.29%). Men were the most likely to suffer burns, up to three times more often than women (n = 1574, 73.07% vs. n = 570, 26.46%. T29—burns to multiple body areas (n = 890)—and T21—burns to the trunk (n = 255)—were most frequently reported as diagnoses according to the ICD-10 classification. A statistically significant association was found between age group and ICD-10 diagnosis (p < 0.001). The vast majority of patients were transported from the scene directly to Burn Treatment Centers (n = 1373; 63.74%). Treatment of pain by helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) crews appeared to be effective (p < 0.001), and other interventions consisted of administering medications—ketamine (23.72%), rocuronium bromide (15.78%), propofol (14.02%)—and procedures such as sedation (30.87%), as well as intubation (13.42%) and mechanical ventilation (13.23%). Conclusions: The burn patient profile indicates men with a mean age of 35 years. Nevertheless, HEMS crews often carry out missions to infants and newborns. The most common diagnosis was extensive body burns. In 63.74% of the missions, patients were transported to the Burn Treatment Center. The HEMS crews implement effective pharmacological analgesia, and handle rescue medications and procedures to stabilize the patient’s condition.",
