## Abstract

Purpuse: The National Emergency Medical Service (NEMS) is facing financial and human resources problems and according to the Supreme Audit Office (SAO), the shortage of doctors and the financial problems will increase. The purpose of the paper is to show that the introduction of live streaming to the Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs) will mitigate the problems resulting from the shortage of medical staff and will significantly reduce the cost of maintaining the operational readiness of the EMTs.
Methodology:The paper is based on applicable legislation and the Provincial Action Plan of the NEMS system for the Pomorskie Province. The forecast was prepared for the outlays and effects of the new organisation and operation of the NEMS system in Pomorskie Province.
Findings: The implementation of live streaming in Pomorskie Province would help reduce the cost of operation of the NEMS system in the province by PLN 10,190,800.00 per year. In addition, this tool would allow the system to operate with only 16 physicians employed, which corresponds to 10% of the current resources and about 90% of the physicians could be employed in other parts of the healthcare system.
