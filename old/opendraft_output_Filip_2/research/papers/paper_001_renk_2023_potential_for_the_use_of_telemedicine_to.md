### Research Question
The paper addresses the critical shortage of physicians in the Polish National Emergency Medical Service (NEMS) and the rising financial costs of maintaining operational readiness. The core question is: Can the implementation of live streaming/telemedicine tools in Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs) mitigate staffing shortages and reduce operational costs without compromising care quality?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Economic forecasting and organizational modeling.
- **Approach:** The authors analyzed the Provincial Action Plan for Pomorskie Province and applicable legislation. They constructed a simulation model comparing the current "physician-on-board" model against a "tele-support" model.
- **Data:** Financial data from the Pomorskie Province NEMS system; human resource allocation statistics.

### Key Findings
1. **Cost Reduction:** The implementation of live streaming support systems is projected to reduce NEMS operational costs in Pomorskie Province by **PLN 10,190,800.00 per year**.
2. **Staffing Optimization:** The proposed model allows the system to operate effectively with only **16 physicians** employed for the specific oversight role.
3. **Resource Reallocation:** This change represents utilizing only **10%** of the current physician resources required for ambulances, meaning approximately **90%** of physicians currently riding in ambulances could be redeployed to other critical sectors of the healthcare system (e.g., Hospital Emergency Wards).

### Implications
This finding is transformative for the Polish healthcare system. It suggests that the "Specialist" ambulance teams (S-type, with a doctor) could be largely replaced by "Basic" teams (P-type, paramedics only) supported by remote physicians. This shifts the paradigm from "bringing the doctor to the patient" to "bringing the doctor's expertise to the paramedic," solving the chronic staffing crisis.

### Limitations
- **Technological Reliance:** The model assumes robust connectivity for live streaming, which may be inconsistent in rural areas [VERIFY coverage maps].
- **Legal Barriers:** Implementation requires legislative changes regarding the definition of medical acts performed remotely.
- **Simulation vs. Reality:** The data is forecasted; real-world friction (equipment failure, user adoption) is not empirically tested in this specific paper.

### Notable Citations
- **Supreme Audit Office (NIK) Reports:** Cited to establish the baseline of the deepening staff shortage crisis.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
**Why:** This is a cornerstone paper for the "Future Directions" section of your research. It provides concrete financial and staffing metrics (PLN 10M savings, 90% staff reallocation) supporting the shift toward Healthcare 4.0 in EMS.
