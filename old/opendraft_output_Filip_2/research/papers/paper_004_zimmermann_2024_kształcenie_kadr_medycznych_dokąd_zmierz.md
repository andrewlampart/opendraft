**Authors:** Zimmermann, A.

### Research Question
How should medical education in Poland evolve to meet modern health needs, specifically regarding the "unpredictable and constantly changing environment" (e.g. Pandemics, war, rapid tech changes)?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Policy review and consensus statement.
- **Approach:** Summary of the 2023 Recommendations of the Conference of Rectors of Academic Medical Schools (KRAUM).
- **Data:** Expert consensus from representatives of all Polish medical universities.

### Key Findings
1. **Competency Shift:** A move away from pure knowledge retention toward soft skills, adaptability, and technological literacy.
2. **Interdisciplinary Training:** Recommendation to integrate training across medical professions (nurses, doctors, paramedics) to improve team dynamics.
3. **Responsiveness:** Curricula must be flexible enough to update rapidly in response to public health crises (lessons learned from COVID-19).

### Implications
This paper sets the theoretical groundwork for the "staffing solution" proposed in Paper 1. If telemedicine is the future, education (as per Zimmermann) must pivot to train doctors and paramedics in digital competencies.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Why:** Connects the "Human Factors" (Paper 5) with the "Technology" (Paper 1). It argues that fixing the system requires fixing the *education* first.
