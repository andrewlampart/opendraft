## Abstract

The healthcare system is a complex organization designed to provide medical services, exhibiting heterogeneity due to economic, legal, and cultural differences. To effectively manage the resilience of healthcare systems, it is essential to model their working domains. Furthermore, healthcare systems at different levels have distinct structures and substance flow characteristics. In particular, at the departmental level, the substance flow is primarily patient-centric, while at the hospital level, it includes orders, bills, and report flows. Interhospital scenarios may involve case flows and healthcare personnel movements. Therefore, this article proposes a healthcare system domain modeling framework based on the function-context-behavior-principle-state-structure (FCBPSS) tool, outlining its application in three hierarchical healthcare system levels. Unlike FCBPSS applications in other systems engineering fields, this framework not only captures the system's semantics but also encompasses ethical rules and operational standards within the healthcare system, making it an ideal tool for healthcare system domain modeling. Finally, the model's effectiveness is validated through the optimization of a case study at Sheng-Jing Hospital in Shenyang.
