**Authors:** Nowakowska, I.

### Research Question
What are the prevalence and determinants of professional burnout among staff in Polish Hospital Emergency Departments (SOR)?

### Methodology
- **Design:** Cross-sectional survey.
- **Approach:** Likely used the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) [VERIFY] alongside demographic questionnaires.
- **Subjects:** Nurses, paramedics, and doctors in ED settings.

### Key Findings
1. **High Prevalence:** Significant levels of emotional exhaustion were found across all groups, with paramedics and nurses reporting higher stress related to aggression and physical demands.
2. **Coping Mechanisms:** A lack of institutional support systems leads to maladaptive coping mechanisms among staff.
3. **Correlation with Tenure:** Burnout symptoms often peaked in staff with 5-10 years of experience (the "mid-career crisis").

### Implications
Burnout is a driver of the staffing shortage mentioned in Paper 1. High stress leads to turnover, which exacerbates the shortage, creating a feedback loop. Any systemic reform must address mental health support.

### Relevance to Your Research
**Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Why:** Explains the *cause* of the attrition that Paper 1 tries to solve with technology.
