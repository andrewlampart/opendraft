## Abstract

The US healthcare system is overwhelmed with staffing shortages, rising costs of care and the overutilisation of emergency rooms and hospitals. Value-based care initiatives work to address these issues, but hospitals, health systems and payers cannot solve these problems alone. Partnerships with post-acute home-based care providers offer specialised, person-centred care aligning with patient and family preferences for receiving care at home. This paper shares details and results from a partnership between Ascension, one of the nation’s leading non-profit and Catholic health systems, and 136 hospitals serving communities in 18 states and the District of Columbia, and Compassus, a leading national provider of integrated home-based care services including home health, hospice, palliative care and infusion. This case study touches on how successful partnership can mitigate various challenges in the healthcare landscape while supporting home-based care, which is projected to experience the most robust growth in post-acute care over the next five years. Readers will learn how Ascension and Compassus designed a mutually beneficial partnership by aligning organisational goals and shared care and quality objectives. The partnership’s success is illustrated through two market examples aimed at improving patient outcomes and satisfaction. The paper also provides recommendations for future collaboration and opportunity, including predictions for how pending legislation could affect the success of similar partnerships and considerations for organisations looking to develop their own value-based care partnership solutions.
