**Research Problem and Approach:** Public health protection constitutes a fundamental state obligation, with the State Emergency Medical Services (PRM) serving as the critical first line of defense in Poland. This research addresses the pressing problem of organizational dysfunction within the PRM system, specifically within the Pomeranian region, amidst dynamic demographic transitions, staff shortages, and technological evolution. The study investigates the widening gap between theoretical legal frameworks and the practical realities of emergency response, arguing that the current model requires urgent re-evaluation to ensure public safety and system resilience.

**Methodology and Findings:** Employing a regional case study approach supported by an interdisciplinary literature review, this research analyzes the organizational, financial, and legal determinants of the PRM system. The methodology examines the impact of external factors such as an aging population and the COVID-19 pandemic on operational efficiency. Key findings reveal that despite numerous reforms, the system remains vulnerable due to critical personnel deficits, high burnout rates, and the slow adoption of "Healthcare 4.0" technologies, creating significant barriers to effective value-based healthcare delivery.

**Key Contributions:** This study makes three primary contributions to the field of public health management: (1) A comprehensive diagnosis of the PRM system's operational capacity in the Pomeranian Voivodeship, isolating specific local and universal challenges; (2) An identification of critical bottlenecks related to human capital management, specifically regarding the aging workforce and paramedic burnout; and (3) A critical assessment of the legal and ethical barriers hindering the implementation of telemedicine and integrated command support systems.

**Implications:** The implications of this research extend to health policy formulation and emergency management strategy. The findings suggest that ensuring the long-term stability of the PRM requires a paradigm shift towards value-based models that integrate technological innovation with robust support for medical personnel. Consequently, this work provides actionable insights for policymakers seeking to enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of emergency services in the face of modern public health threats.
