# Paper Architecture: Master's Thesis

**Paper Type:** Empirical Master's Thesis (Mixed-Methods: Document Analysis + Case Study + Spatial/Data Analysis)
**Research Question:** How effective are the organizational mechanisms of the State Medical Rescue (PRM) system in the Pomeranian Voivodeship in implementing state public health policy, particularly regarding the transition from physician-led to paramedic-led teams?
**Target Venue:** University Repository / Academic Defense
**Estimated Length:** 25,000 - 30,000 words (approx. 80-100 pages)

## Core Argument Flow

**Draft Statement:**
The administration of State Medical Rescue (PRM) in Pomerania is successfully optimizing costs by shifting from Specialist (S) to Basic (P) teams, but this organizational transition creates unaddressed risks in rural "connectivity blind spots" where the tele-support model fails.

**Logical Progression:**
1. **Context:** State policy dictates a move toward paramedic-led systems to solve doctor shortages (Introduction/Background).
2. **Problem:** The Pomeranian region presents unique geographical challenges that complicate this standardized policy (Context).
3. **Analysis (Admin):** The Governor's (Wojewoda) planning effectively manages administrative structure but lacks real-time operational feedback loops (Institutional Analysis).
4. **Analysis (Operational):** The shift from "S" to "P" teams saves money (Paper 1 validation) but assumes technological reliability that doesn't exist in all rural areas (Addressing Gap 1 & 2).
5. **Synthesis:** Effective public health policy in Pomerania requires a hybrid model that accounts for cellular coverage realities, not just demographic demand (Discussion/Recommendations).

## Argument Flow Map for the Student

```
Introduction: Public policy aims for efficiency (less doctors, more paramedics).
 ↓
Context: Pomerania has 93 teams, but diverse geography (Urban vs Rural).
 ↓
Admin Analysis: The Governor plans based on demographics/budget (Standard approach).
 ↓
Gap Identification: Standard planning misses the "Connectivity Paradox" (Gap 1).
 ↓
Operational Analysis: Converting S-teams to P-teams saves money...
 ↓
Critical Finding:...BUT in rural Pomerania, P-teams lose tele-support due to bad coverage.
 ↓
Synthesis: The system is administratively efficient but operationally risky in specific zones.
 ↓
Recommendation: Policy must link "Team Type" to "Digital Infrastructure" availability.
```

## Evidence Placement Strategy

| Chapter | Source/Data Type | Purpose |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| Ch 1-2 | Legal Acts, Literature | Establish the "Ideal Model" of PRM. |
| Ch 4 | Regional Statistics (GUS) | Define the testing ground (Pomerania). |
| Ch 5 | NIK Reports, Wojewoda Plan | Critique the administrative process. |
| Ch 6 | Paper 1 (Economic Forecasts) | Acknowledge financial benefits of "P" teams. |
| Ch 7 | GIS Data + Paper 2 (Rural/Connectivity) | **Prove the Research Gap:** Show where the model fails. |
| Ch 8 | Synthesis of findings | Propose the "Digital-Operational" planning model. |

## Writing Priorities for the Student

1. **The "Wojewoda" Role:** Since the title emphasizes "State Policy Implementation," ensure Chapter 5 strongly analyzes the Governor's specific powers and decisions. Don't just describe them; evaluate them.
2. **The "S" vs "P" Debate:** This is the hottest topic in Polish EMS. Use the research gaps provided to take a nuanced stance: "P-teams are good, BUT only if the technology works."
3. **Data Visualization:** A Master's thesis needs maps. Chapter 7 should ideally include a map showing PRM stations overlaid with response time radii.

## ⚠️ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY CHECK

- **Verify Regional Data:** Ensure access to the "Wojewódzki Plan Działania Systemu Państwowego Ratownictwa Medycznego dla Województwa Pomorskiego" (usually available as a PDF on the Urząd Wojewódzki website). This is your primary source document.
- **Verify Stats:** When citing the number of teams (93), ensure this is the current count for the specific year of analysis, as these numbers change slightly with plan updates.
