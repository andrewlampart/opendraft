### Abstract
**Length:** 300-500 words
**Structure:**
1. **Background:** The transition from physician-led (S) to paramedic-led (P) teams in Poland.
2. **Problem:** The geographic and infrastructure challenges specific to Pomerania (the "connectivity blind spot").
3. **Methods:** Mixed-methods approach (Document analysis of Governor's plans + Spatial analysis of coverage).
4. **Results:** Administrative efficiency is high, but operational safety in rural areas is compromised by tele-support failures.
5. **Conclusion:** A hybrid model is required to ensure equity in health access.

**Keywords:** State Medical Rescue (PRM), Public Health Policy, Pomeranian Voivodeship, Paramedic Teams, Tele-medicine, Health Security.

## Chapter 1: Introduction
**Estimated Length:** 2,500 words

### 1.1 Background of the Study
- Overview of the State Medical Rescue (PRM) system in Poland.
- The legislative shift: Act on State Medical Rescue (Ustawa o Państwowym Ratownictwie Medycznym).
- The trend: Replacing Specialist (S) teams with Basic (P) teams.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
- The tension between economic optimization (cost-cutting) and operational security.
- The specific geography of Pomerania (rural vs. urban density).
- The reliance on tele-transmission/consultation for paramedics replacing doctors.

### 1.3 Research Question and Hypotheses
- **RQ:** How effective are the organizational mechanisms of the PRM system in Pomerania in implementing state policy, particularly regarding the S-to-P transition?
- **H1:** The administrative centralization by the Voivode (Governor) has improved cost-efficiency.
- **H2:** The reduction of physician-led teams creates safety gaps in areas with poor cellular coverage ("blind spots").

### 1.4 Research Objectives
1. To evaluate the administrative structure of the PRM in Pomerania.
2. To analyze the spatial distribution of PRM teams relative to population and infrastructure.
3. To identify risks associated with the "tele-support" model in rural areas.

### 1.5 Thesis Structure
- Brief roadmap of the chapters.

## Chapter 2: Literature Review & Theoretical Framework
**Estimated Length:** 6,000 words

### 2.1 Public Health Policy Implementation
- Theories of New Public Management (NPM) in healthcare.
- Centralization vs. Decentralization in emergency services.

### 2.2 Emergency Medicine Models
- **The Franco-German Model:** Physician on the scene (The historical Polish model).
- **The Anglo-American Model:** Paramedic/EMT on scene + Transport (The target model).
- **The Polish Hybrid:** The current state of transition.

### 2.3 The Legal and Organizational Context in Poland
- Evolution of the PRM system post-1999.
- Role of the Voivode (Governor) vs. National Health Fund (NFZ).
- **Table 1:** Comparison of Competencies: Voivode vs. Dispatch Centers.

### 2.4 Previous Studies on PRM Efficiency
- Review of NIK (Supreme Audit Office) reports.
- Academic literature on rural health access in Poland.
- Gap Analysis: Lack of studies combining administrative analysis with spatial/telecom data.

## Chapter 3: Methodology
**Estimated Length:** 3,000 words

### 3.1 Research Design
- Mixed-Methods approach: Qualitative (Document/Institutional Analysis) + Quantitative (Spatial/Data Analysis).

### 3.2 Data Sources
- **Document Analysis:** Voivodeship Action Plans (Wojewódzki Plan Działania Systemu PRM) 2018-2024.
- **Statistical Data:** Intervention times, team composition changes (S vs P).
- **Spatial Data:** GIS data on team locations and cellular network coverage maps (for the "blind spot" argument).

### 3.3 Analytical Procedures
1. **Institutional Analysis:** Evaluating the Governor's planning efficacy.
2. **Case Study Selection:** Criteria for selecting specific Pomeranian counties (powiats).
3. **Spatial Analysis:** Overlaying team reduction zones with cellular coverage maps.

### 3.4 Limitations
- Data availability regarding specific medical outcomes (GDPR restrictions).
- Accuracy of cellular coverage maps vs. real-world signal.

## Chapter 4: Institutional Analysis: The Administrative Perspective
**Estimated Length:** 5,000 words
*Focus: The "Plan" and Economic Optimization*

### 4.1 The Role of the Pomeranian Voivode
- Analysis of the planning process.
- **Figure 1:** Organizational Structure of PRM in Pomerania.

### 4.2 The "S" to "P" Transition: Statistical Overview
- Quantitative analysis of the reduction in Specialist teams.
- **Table 2:** Evolution of Team Structure (S vs P) in Pomerania (2015-2024).
- **Figure 2:** Trend Line of Operational Costs vs. Team Count.

### 5.1 Geographic Challenges of Pomerania
- Analysis of road infrastructure and travel times.
- **Figure 3:** Heat Map of Intervention Times in Rural vs. Urban Zones.

### 5.2 The "Connectivity Blind Spot" Analysis
- The tele-support requirement: Paramedics must consult doctors remotely.
- **Figure 4:** Overlay Map: Areas where "S" teams were removed vs. Areas of poor Cellular Coverage.
- *Key Finding:* Identification of "High Risk Zones" where tele-support is technically impossible.

- Restate that safety risks were increased in specific geographic pockets.

### 7.2 Recommendations
- **Hybrid Model Proposal:** Retain "S" teams specifically in "digital shadow" areas.
- **Infrastructure Investment:** Prioritize cellular infrastructure for emergency services.

### 7.3 Future Research Directions

## Quality Checklist for Crafter Agents

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Table & Figure Numbering
Maintain global counters across chapters.
- If **Table 2** is in Chapter 4, the first table in Chapter 5 must be **Table 3**.
- Do not restart numbering at the start of a new chapter.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Citation of Polish Sources
When citing Polish legal acts or reports in the text, use the translated title in brackets or the Polish abbreviation if defined.
- *Example:* (Act on State Medical Rescue [Ustawa o PRM], 2006).
- *Reference List:* Must include original Polish title and English translation in brackets.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Tone
- Avoid "journalistic" criticism of the government.
- Use objective, evidence-based language.
- Instead of "The government failed," use "The current policy framework does not fully account for infrastructure limitations."
